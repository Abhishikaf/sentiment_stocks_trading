0,2022-01-10,"Why Tesla Stock First Crashed, Then Bounced Today","What happened

Topsy-turvy Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock -- which spent most of last week on a downswing -- suffered another sell-off early Monday morning, falling by nearly 5%. But by 10 a.m., it seemed that the market's view was moderating, and the stock bounced. It was still in the red as of 11:40 a.m., but only by about 0.4%.

So what good news helped Tesla cut its losses Monday?

So what

Take your pick -- because as it turns out, this is looking like a pretty good news day for Tesla. In fact, if it weren't for the Nasdaq as a whole being down by 1.9% at the same point Monday morning, I kind of think Tesla would be in the green!

At least three analysts were singing Tesla's praises, you see.

First, Wedbush just reiterated its outperform rating on the stock, reports StreetInsider.com, and with a $1,400 price target that implies nearly 40% upside in the stock this year.

Tesla's launch of Model Y production at its new factory in Austin, Texas, sets the company up ""to have a massive year in 2022,"" reports Wedbush. The new production facility will become ""the centerpiece of Tesla's broader supply ambitions as well as its formal HQ buildout,"" and could help double the company's capacity to 2 million vehicles per year.

At Global Equities Research, the view is similarly upbeat, with analysts saying Tesla is heading into 2022 looking ""extremely strong,"" and ""even more stronger than what we saw on December 28, 2021."" (""Even more stronger?"" I have to say -- that sounds pretty strong.)

Now what

Rounding out the list of Tesla fans Monday is Goldman Sachs. While not quite as optimistic as Wedbush, Goldman does expect Tesla stock to gain about 20% this year, based on its $1,200 price target.

""Given its leadership position in EVs ... and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses),"" Goldman asserted Monday in a note covered on TheFly.com that Tesla is ""best positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs"" worldwide. As the company grows in size -- and remember here Wedbush's comment on production capacity doubling -- Goldman anticipates that Tesla will reap economies of scale sufficient to expand its profit margin.

Granted, I don't know that Tesla will be able to expand its profit margins enough to totally justify its staggering 330 price-to-earnings ratio. But when you consider that at a net profit margin of 7.4%, Tesla is already more than three times more profitable per dollar of revenue than Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) with its 2.1% net profit margin, a further expansion of profit margins still bodes pretty well for its future.","What happenedTopsy-turvy Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock -- which spent most of last week on a downswing -- suffered another sell-off early Monday morning, falling by nearly 5%.

1,2022-01-10,Solar Power and Battery Storage Will Be the Real Test for Tesla,"Elon Musk has long insisted that Tesla Inc. is more than just a carmaker. Now that vision, which for years has taken a back seat to the challenges of vehicle production, is coming into focus. In 2022, Musk’s electric auto company is making a serious effort to become a more important supplier of energy storage, both for people’s homes and for the power grid writ large.

“Over time, we think the demand for stationary storage is going to be at least as high as the demand for vehicles,” Musk said during the company’s annual shareholder meeting in October.","Elon Musk has long insisted that Tesla Inc. is more than just a carmaker.

""We believe that Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) will be best positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs,"" wrote Delaney in a note to investors.

""We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue,"" he continued.

The analyst raised his 12-month price target on Tesla to $1,200 and maintained a Buy rating, citing ""robust 4Q21 deliveries.""

Tesla shares declined on Monday amid an over sell-off in technology and growth stocks. The 10-year treasury yield (^TNX) inched up to 1.8%, creating selling pressure on the high flying stocks of last year.

The recent decline comes after a stellar start to the new year. The stock gained 13% in one day on the first trading day of 2022 after the electric vehicle (EV) giant's fourth quarter vehicle deliveries smashed estimates.

The company delivered a record 308,600 cars during the last three months. Its deliveries shot up 87% year-over-year to 936,172 for all of 2021.

Tesla's (TSLA) record deliveries highlight a ""trophy-case quarter,"" Wedbush managing director and analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance last week.

""This was a jaw-dropper quarter,"" Ives said. ""This just shows massive momentum in terms of the green tidal wave going into 2022.""

Story continues

Ives predicts Tesla will hit a $2 trillion market capitalization in about 18 months. The company hit $1 trillion in valuation for the first time in October of last year.

7,2022-01-10,New plants will help Tesla (TSLA ) double capacity in 2022,"Tesla is on the verge of opening a new Austin, Texas, manufacturing plant, which will help the EV maker double its production capacity this year, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.

The Austin plant opening has been highly anticipated for months but Tesla has not specified an exact launch date.

According to Ives, its opening will also be bolstered by a new company plant in Berlin, Germany. The opening of the Berlin plant is currently delayed due to regulatory issues.

“We believe, by the end of 2022, Tesla will have the capacity (to build) two million (vehicles) annually, (up) from roughly one million today,” Ives wrote in an analyst report.

The Austin plant, known as Gigafactory Texas, is expected to build Model Y crossovers with truck formats to follow.

“Launching the Austin production is very important to Tesla expanding both domestic and global production of Model Ys which are set to have a massive year in 2022,” Ives wrote.

Stock price climbs

Tesla’s (TSLA) stock price jumped Monday after Ives’ report circulated. After falling in the morning, the stock closed up 3.03% on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and increased another 4.01% in early after-hours trading.

Ives expects Tesla’s actual production to range from between 1.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles annually.

Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles in 2021, with Model 3s and Model Ys accounting for 911,208, according to a recent company release.

The Austin and Berlin plants will be Tesla’s third and fourth. Tesla currently has plants operating in Fremont, California, and Shanghai, China.

Demand outstripping supply

Ives said the Austin and Berlin openings will alleviate Model 3 and Model Y supply-chain pressures and ease production bottlenecks that are causing five-to-six-month delivery delays.

Although near-term logistical hurdles will pose a cost burden, Tesla has the potential to further expand its “profitability profile” over the next 12 to 18 months, especially with more higher-margin sales in China, Ives wrote.

Ives reiterated an outperform rating for Tesla stock, along with a $1,400 price target and $1,800 bull price target.

No major roadblocks

“I don’t see any major roadblocks, (to the Austin plant opening)” said Morningstar senior equity analyst Seth Goldstein, who chairs Morningstar's EV committee. “Whenever any company is opening a new production plant, there is always the potential for hiccups in order to ramp up production, but any issues should be temporary.”

Goldstein said the plant will probably produce Model Ys first and then, eventually, the Cybertruck pickup, which has faced design and development delays, and the Semi, a semi-truck to be used for hauling freight.

But the Austin plant opening will have little impact on Tesla’s stock, which has languished early in 2022, he said.

Plant opening built into price

“I don’t think it will mean much as it’s already priced in,’ Goldstein said. “The current stock price already implies Tesla will become one of the largest automakers in the world. As such, this implies the company will successfully open the factory and ramp up production with no major long-term issues.”

Both the Austin and Berlin plant openings will greatly expand Tesla’s overall production in 2022 and 2023, he added.

“(The openings) should result in the company continuing to grow and easily surpass one million deliveries this year,” Goldstein said.

The difference between trading assets and CFDs

The main difference between CFD trading and trading assets, such as commodities and stocks, is that you don’t own the underlying asset when you trade on a CFD.

You can still benefit if the market moves in your favour, or make a loss if it moves against you. However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.

CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.

CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer. You might also pay a broker commission or fees when buying and selling assets direct and you’d need somewhere to store them safely.

8,2022-01-10,Tesla Stock: Is Tech Edge Enough over Competitors?,"I am neutral on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as it has a very strong moat, rapid growth momentum, and a compelling technological edge that should serve it well moving forward.

On the other hand, it trades a massive valuation multiple premium.

Tesla is a manufacturer of home power storage and car batteries, solar panels, and EVs. The EV manufacturing company was founded in 2003; the company gained massive following after the release of Tesla Roadster, the world’s first electric sports car.

Its customers are spread across the globe and Tesla has over 70,757 employees in total, according to the 2020 reports. Its factory is located in Fremont, California, and the headquarters are in Austin, Texas.

It is also known as one of the most valuable automakers in the industry that is constantly working toward sustainable, budget-friendly solutions for its targeted customer base.

Strengths

In 2021, Tesla’s Model 3 became the first electric car to cross the 1-million mark for total units sold across the globe. Innovative capabilities and a niche target audience give this company a greater competitive edge than some its competitors in the industry.

In 2019, Tesla was also named one of the best employers of the year by Forbes, and its employment rate has only increased since then. Highly skilled and talented employees aside, the company is also known as the leading automotive company, after the spike in Tesla Model 3 sales.

The strong brand image and customer-focused approach give Tesla robust brand equity.

Recent Results

In 2020, the total revenues generated by Tesla reached $31.5 billion and gross profit reached $6.6 billion. In 2019, these numbers totaled $24.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. The basic and diluted earnings per share finally showed a positive trend since the 2016 results, with $0.74 and $0.64 attributed to them, respectively.

The gross margin also increased to 21% in 2020, compared to 17% and 19% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues remained consistent between 2019 and 2020 at 5%.

In 2021, TSLA has seen massive growth, with revenues expected to rise by 65.3%, EBITDA expected to soar by 88%, and normalized net income expected to nearly triple.

Valuation Metrics

TSLA stock looks richly priced at the moment. Its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is high relative to its history at 63.4x compared to its historical average of 40.7x.

Moreover, its P/E ratio is also very elevated at 111.5x compared to its historical average of 66.4x.

Wall Street’s Take

According to Wall Street analysts, TSLA earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 15 Buy ratings, nine Hold ratings, and six Sell ratings in the past three months. Additionally, the average Tesla price target of $1,028.59 puts the upside potential at 0.2%.

Summary and Conclusions

Tesla is a clear global leader in EVs as it boasts best-in-class technology, particularly on the battery front.

It is led by visionary CEO Elon Musk, has finally proven that it can be profitable, is growing rapidly, and it also possesses a compelling advantage in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology. The future certainly looks bright for the company.

That said, the stock has soared in recent years which means that the valuation is extremely stretched.

9,2022-01-10,Tesla Hikes Price on Full Self-Driving to $12K,"The world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is increasing the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature to $12,000, effective from January 17, 2022. Meanwhile, TSLA shares closed down 3.5% at $1,026.96 on January 7.

FSD Feature

Tesla formally released the FSD Beta Button in the last week of September to select drivers based on their safety scores. In October 2022, the price of the FSD was raised by $2,000 for the first time.

The latest price hike was announced by CEO Elon Musk in a tweet saying, “Tesla FSD price rising to $12k on January 17.” The reason for the price hike remains unknown.

According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard, Tesla’s FSD feature is currently rated at Level 2, which implies that the autonomous vehicle can control both steering and speed. The level requires the driver to be attentive and take control of the car when required.

Tesla regularly updates its FSD Beta feature once every two weeks. The FSD feature comes at a subscription fee of $99 per month and can be canceled at any time. The feature includes navigation on Autopilot Beta, auto lane change, smart summon, Traffic and Stop Sign control Beta, Autosteer, and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.

Analysts’ View

Recently, analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $1,400, which implies 36.3% upside potential to current levels.

According to Ives, Tesla’s Giga factories in Berlin and Austin are a focal point for the Street. Ives is very optimistic about the production of Model Y, which he believes will have a massive year in 2022.

The analyst said, “Based on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7-10 days. We also believe the stamping machines for Model Y and testing is already in place and mostly completed, with paperwork now filed by Tesla to officially start key production in Austin over the next week.”

Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, 9 Holds, and 5 Sells. The average Tesla price target of $1,053.73 (2.6% upside potential to current levels). Meanwhile, TSLA shares have gained 26.6% over the past year.

10,2022-01-10,Tesla Trap Not Hard To Miss,"Tesla Daily Chart.

The trap move on the daily chart for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was impossible to miss if you use volume price analysis as the foundation of your trading methodology. A volatility trigger also pointed to it. So, in effect, there were two reasons to see this move clearly. Let’s take a look.

The trap in question occurred on Jan. 3 as markets resumed after the holiday season. This alone should have been a warning. When markets are thinly traded in and around holidays, it is the perfect opportunity for market makers to step in and create traps of all kinds, moving prices quickly on low volume to tempt traders into the market on the fear of missing out. This is the power of volatility. It triggers FOMO, or the fear of missing out. It is something market makers use to great effect.

In this case, the gapped-up open was extreme, moving more than $100 per share, before adding a further $60 per share to the price and closing a shade under $1,200 at $1,199.78. However, from a volume-price-analysis perspective, the question we should ask ourselves is this: Does the volume look sufficient to not only drive the price this much on the day but also the extent to which the gap was driven higher?

The short answer is no.

Always remember Wyckoff’s third law of effort and result. The effort (volume) required here would be enormous to move the price this far, and yet, it is average, perhaps a little above average for Tesla but no more. So we can conclude it is a trap move. It has to be. But it no doubt drew in many traders and investors sensing a pickup in the longer-term bullish trend and perhaps dreaming of seeing the price climb like one of Elon’s rockets on to $1,500 per share and beyond, which it may well do in good time. Sadly, as soon as they are drawn in, the jaws of the trap snap shut as the selling develops on good volume, taking the price below the point at which it began the ill-fated gap-up.

In addition, and as I mentioned above, the move was also confirmed with a volatility trigger on the Quantumtrading indicator. As such, we expect one of two things to follow. Either congestion or a reversal. In this case, it has been the latter, with the price closing last week at $1,026.96 per share and back at the VPOC denoted with the yellow dashed line. Moving forward, we can expect to see further congestion. But for those trapped above, or stopped out, hopefully, a lesson has been learned.

Finally, remember the old adage – gaps get filled!","The trap move on the daily chart for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was impossible to miss if you use volume price analysis as the foundation of your trading methodology.

Stocks were getting pressured as yields continued to rise, yet the heavy selling eased late in the session. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ended up closing down slightly at 1.77%.

Nasdaq Reverses Higher; Growth Stocks Battle Back

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fought back well after an early pounding. It closed with a razor-thin gain of under 0.1%. Moderna (MRNA) was the top performer, rising 9.3% after the company firm updated its pipeline at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. It also hiked guidance for advanced purchase agreements for product sales to about $18.5 billion this year, up from a prior report of $17 billion.

The S&P 500 also narrowed losses as it closed down 0.1%. Humana (HUM) was among the best performers here, rising 6.1%. Shares got bashed in the first trading week of 2022.

It has also fallen back after briefly passing a double-bottom base buy point of 1202.05. Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4. The stock is nearly 15% below this level. It remains up more than 30% over the past 12 months however. TSLA stock is a member of the prestigious IBD Leaderboard list of leading growth stocks.

Tilray Helps Marijuana Stocks With Surprise

Marijuana stocks were given a boost after industry beast Tilray reported a surprise profit.

The company also revealed revenue jumped about 20% to $155 million amid stronger demand for cannabis products. This missed FactSet estimates for $170.5 million.

The marijuana stock surged 14% on the earning surprise, before coming down to close with a gain of about 12%. Despite this it remains mired under its 50-day line.

Tilray last month bought Colorado-based Breckenridge Distillery, a move that adds to a U.S. presence that consists of a craft brewer and hemp-granola maker, along with an investment deal with struggling cannabis retailer MedMen.

Other cannabis stocks also got higher on the news. Canopy Growth (CGC) rose more than 2%, Aurora Cannabis (ACB) popped over 4% while Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF) posted a marginal gain.

However, marijuana REIT Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) fell more than 4%. IIPR stock also took out its long-term 200-day moving average.

Bears, Bulls Battle Over Chips

Chip stocks struggled early, but managed to erase most of their losses heading into the close.

Nvidia (NVDA) managed to close up 0.6% after being mauled by the bears in early action. Nevertheless, it remains well shy of the key 10-week moving average.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed virtually flat amid the seesaw action. Whether this is a turning point remains to be seen, as it is still under its 50-day line.

Qualcomm (QCOM) closed off lows, but still fell 0.4%. The 50-day moving average provided support, an encouraging sign.

Alpha & Omega Semiconductor, a member of the prestigious IBD 50 list, closed with a painful loss of over 4%. It did manage to hold firm at the 50-day line though.

Both AMD and Qualcomm were axed from the IBD Leaderboard list of leading growth stocks Monday amid stuttering performance.

These Stocks Pass Buy Points

W. R. Berkley closed below a flat-base entry after briefly moving above its ideal entry point of 85.03. This is a second stage pattern, which is a positive for the insurance play.

The relative strength line is picking up but the fact earnings are due January 27 gives investors another reason for pause.

East West Bancorp also closed below its entry after trying to break out of a cup-without-handle base. The ideal entry here is 87.87.

Regional bank stocks have been performing well of late but earnings are also imminent for this EWBC stock.

With the market uptrend currently under pressure it is not advisable to open new positions at the current time.

It is worth keeping a close tab on stocks performing well under these conditions and add them to one's watchlist however.

13,2022-01-10,US STOCKS-Nasdaq ekes out gain in late session comeback,"By Sinéad Carew and Caroline Valetkevitch

Jan 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes staged a late-session comeback on Monday as the Nasdaq managed to eke out a tiny gain and investors swooped in to hunt for bargains, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished well above their session lows.

After falling almost 3% earlier in the day and as much as 10.37% below its intraday record level reached on Nov. 22, the technology-heavy Nasdaq pointed sharply higher to regain all its losses for the day in afternoon trading.

While investors spent the morning fretting about rising bond yields and what this week's inflation data might mean for U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening, others took advantage of earlier nerves to buy the dip.

""We've gotten to the point where you wonder if the roller coaster has peaked and is heading straight down. But fundamentally there's a lot of buyers in this market buying on the dip,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner of Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey who attributed much of the afternoon strength to retail investors buying favorite stocks such as Tesla TSLA.O.

Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago also attributed the late session comeback to dip-buyers looking at U.S. Treasury yields fall from their peaks of the day.

""Some of the tech names are off 5 to 10 percent or more, and people are looking at that and going that looks pretty good - time to snap them up,"" said Nolte.

""The other thing though to keep an eye on is what happens to interest rates because that has really been what's been dragging technology. We saw little bit of a reversal late in the day in (Treasury yields). They came down just a touch and that was a little bit of a green light for tech investors,"" he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 162.79 points, or 0.45%, to 36,068.87, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6.74 points, or 0.14%, to 4,670.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 6.93 points, or 0.05%, to 14,942.83.

After starting the day among the biggest laggards, the S&P technology index .SPLRCT managed to eke out a tiny gain of 0.1%, behind the healthcare sector .SPXHC which closed up 1% and ahead of communications services .SPLRCR which, rising 0.02%, was the session's only other gainer among the 11 major industry sectors.

The biggest decliners on the day were industrials .SPLRCI which closed down 1.2% and materials .SPLRCM which dropped 0.99%.

Traders have ramped up their rate hike expectations since the Fed's minutes from the December meeting appeared to signal an earlier-than-expected rate rise.

Goldman Sachs said it expects the Fed to raise rates four times in 2022, compared to its previous forecast of three.

Earlier the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR rose to its highest level in nearly two years on Monday.

After falling as much as 4.6% earlier in the session, Nasdaq heavyweight Tesla TSLA.O made a dramatic turnaround to close up 3%.

Meckler said retail investors appeared to flood back into the stock which had suffered after Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the electric carmaker will raise the U.S. price of its advanced driver assistant software.

Nike NKE.N shares closed down 4.2% after HSBC downgraded the stock to ""hold.""

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 69 new highs and 609 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 12.15 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.55 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

16,2022-01-10,NIO Stock: 2022 Will Be A Good Year For EVs And NIO,"RomoloTavani/iStock via Getty Images

Thesis Summary

NIO Inc (NIO) is a Chinese EV company with global ambitions. Despite what I consider to be a solid 2021 and good prospects for 2022, the share price ended the year well below its all-time high. Is there something investors are missing? What are the risks, challenges, and opportunities going into 2022?

Although competition is certainly intensifying, I see various catalysts going forward, and I maintain my conviction that NIO will be one of the big winners in the EV space.

2021: When Fundamentals Don't Meet Technicals

The year has been significantly volatile, and NIO is no exception.

Source: TradingView

The company entered 2021 with a great rally that took shares from under $15 in September to over $60 by January. The rest of 2021 saw a continued slide in the share price, with NIO shares now hovering around $30.

However, as I've mentioned before, I don't see the recent price depreciation corresponding to fundamental changes. If anything, NIO has made good moves in 2021 and shown great progress.

Firstly, the company made great deals with large energy companies such as China's Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A). This was done to accelerate the rollout of NIO's charging stations and Battery Swap stations, of which it plans to have 4000 by 2025.

Secondly, NIO has now expanded its operations to Norway, and it will continue to do so in 2022, entering five new European countries. Expanding internationally is a must if NIO wants to maintain high growth rates.

Lastly, while the company has had some weak months, overall deliveries have grown to the tune of 109% in 2021. Furthermore, bear in mind that, with the construction of the NeoPark.

The NeoPark will act as a hub for EV companies, and NIO is the main investor. This EV facility is set to have a production value of 500 billion yuan per year, and it should be a good way for NIO to achieve better control over its production.

What To Expect In 2022

With that said, 2022 promises to be a challenging year for NIO and the overall EV industry. If you think the competition was intense in 2021, it is about to get a lot more intense. The year behind us saw the rise of many EV startups, like Chinese-owned XPeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI). More recently, we saw Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) backed Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) make its market debut.

In 2022, however, I'd expect to see much more pressure coming from the ""big boys"". Legacy car manufacturers are not oblivious to what is happening around them and have been working hard in 2021 to compete in the EV space. Those efforts will begin to pay off this year and the next.

Analysts recently pointed to this reality, and companies like Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF), which has the second best-selling EV in Europe, and General Motors (NYSE:GM), which recently landed an EV van deal with Amazon, will be at the centre stage.

The other main challenges in 2022 will be supply constraints and margin suppression due to the increased cost of goods. The most obvious case of this is lithium, which is needed to make batteries. Some analysts believe this could be a challenge moving forward and lithium is not the only component that could be in short supply. Most industries around the world are also competing for semiconductors.

Lastly, NIO will have to battle with the regulatory challenges from China, and its share price may still be burdened by the fear of the CCP narrative.

Why I Like NIO Better Than Chinese EVs And Even Tesla

Despite all these challenges, I still think 2022 will be a good year for EVs and NIO in particular.

First off, I think the anti-Chinese narrative will die down in 2022, and we are already seeing clear evidence of this. Fellow SA contributor Bohdan Kucheriavyi pointed this out in this great article.

Chinese officials have stated that they will not be banning the VIE structure, and the Chinese government has also lifted limitations on foreign investment in auto manufacturing.

This will be a helping hand to NIO and its Chinese peers, but NIO still has better prospects than the others in 2022, and one of the reasons also relates to regulation. China will be reducing EV subsidies by 30% in 2022. These subsidies apply to vehicles priced under $42,000. The thing is, NIO's cars are generally more expensive than this, as they are high-end. This subsidy reduction will effectively render NIO's cars more competitive vis-a-vis its lower-priced peers.

And why do I like NIO more than Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)? Valuation is a factor, with NIO trading at much more attractive metrics.

According to data from Seeking Alpha, NIO has a P/S of 8.78, EV/Sales of 7.65, and a Price to Book of 12.31. Compare this to Tesla's P/S of 21.27, EV/Sales of 19.74, and Price to Book of 38.11. Granted, Tesla has a more favourable Price/Cash flow of 104.07 vs NIO's 121.02, but the latter is a younger company, and I'd expect profitability to catch up.

However, what makes the most difference for me is NIO's presence in the Chinese market and its connection with the government. During the pandemic, NIO received $1.4 billion in aid from the government. Specifically, the government of Hefei offered NIO this cash injection in return for setting up shop in their city. Furthermore, consider that NIO's cars are currently produced by JAC Motors, a government-controlled entity.

Yes, Tesla still dominates in China, but it is a foreign company, and the Chinese won't necessarily keep helping Musk. What if lithium, most of which China controls, runs low? Who do you think will be first in line to get it?

Takeaway

NIO kicks off 2021 at a multi-month low, making it an attractive opportunity to enter or add to an existing position. While I like the fundamental story, we must be wary of curveballs that the market can throw at us. China, supply issues and even the Fed could derail the advance in share prices in the short term. However, my main expectation is that NIO will finally break free of all the noise and speculation which has held down the stock in 2021.

19,2022-01-11,Tesla (TSLA) Stock Rises After Analysts Boost Price Targets,"Tesla, Inc.'s (TSLA) shares reversed course from their recent downward trajectory and rose by 3% on Monday, Jan. 10, after key analysts upped their price targets for the stock. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney confirmed Tesla as a Top Pick for his firm, and Tesla bull Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said that the company was a winner in the electric vehicle (EV) race. Both analysts increased their price targets for Tesla shares.

The increase in share price came after a bruising four-day period for the stock during which its price fell from $1,200 to as low as $980. The decline occurred even after Tesla announced record delivery numbers.

Key Takeaways Electric carmaker Tesla's stock reversed course and rose yesterday after key analyst revisions to its price targets.

Noted Tesla bull Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley revised his price target to $1,300 from $1,200 and stated that Tesla was winning the EV marathon.

Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney rated Tesla stock a Top Pick for 2022 and bumped up its price target to $1,200 from $1,125.

The average price target estimate for the Tesla stock ranges between $849 and $916.

A Marathon Winner

Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said that the current landscape for electric vehicles was a race and that Tesla was winning it. ""Think of the EV race as a marathon,"" he wrote. ""Tesla is in the lead at mile number 21. Everybody else is at mile 2 or still tying their shoes.""



According to Jonas, recent record deliveries of its cars were proof that Tesla's position will become stronger as the marathon progresses. He revised his price target for the automaker's shares to $1,300 from $1,200 and predicted delivery figures of 2 million for 2022. Tesla delivered 936,000 vehicles last year and plans to increase that figure by 50% this year.



Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney bumped Tesla's price target to $1,200 from $1,125. He placed Tesla stock in the Outperform category and called it the ""Best Idea"" in the electric vehicle sector. Like Jonas, Delaney also cited Tesla's leadership position in electric vehicles, adding that global electric vehicle adoption trends could act as a tailwind for the company's sales.

The caveat to this bullish assessment is that adoption rates may not pan out as expected, he wrote. A slowdown has the potential to curtail Tesla's lead and allow competitors, of which there are many, to catch up with the company's tech and infrastructure.



Will Tesla Win the EV Race?

The enthusiasm of analysts for Tesla's stock is centered around the company's operational expertise. During the pandemic, when established car manufacturers struggled with chip shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, Tesla pivoted between suppliers by rewriting its software to keep its factories humming.

It also opened two new manufacturing facilities, in Austin and Berlin, to augment production. These facilities will bolster Tesla's bases in Shanghai and Fremont, California. Collectively, the developments mean increased operational margins and scale to manufacture its vehicles.

""The opening of the Berlin and Austin plants offers an opportunity to achieve even higher gross margins, which we expect Tesla to eventually reinvest into product, service/network expansion, and price,"" Morgan Stanley's Jonas wrote in an earlier note. Already, the company's cars are among best-sellers in several countries, including the United Kingdom and Norway.



Fundamentals aside, Tesla's stock may have run ahead of itself in the markets based on average analyst estimates. Yahoo Finance calculates its average price target (based on analyst notes) at $894, while others have it at $916. There's also the fact that the stock has an astounding price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 345.52, leading one to believe that investors in the company have inflated expectations about its future earnings.

20,2022-01-11,Tesla (TSLA) Inks Nickel Supply Deal With Talon for Battery Cells,"Tesla TSLA recently signed its first nickel supply deal in the United States, selecting Talon Metals Corp's Tamarack mine project in Minnesota in a bid to make the electric vehicle (EV) battery metal in a sustainable way.



Climate-change concerns have peaked in recent times. This calls for developing EV batteries to de-carbonize the global economy, buoying the demand for metals, particularly copper and nickel, used to produce batteries. An expected surge in demand for nickel is anticipated over the next decade as EVs pick up steam and gain popularity. Nickel enhances the energy storing capacity in a battery's cathode, extending an EV's range.



Tesla’s announcement comes in the light of pro-climate change demands. The company is driven in its vision to expedite the transition to green transportation solutions. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, since 2020, has been harping on the focus to pump up nickel production in an environmentally viable way.



The United States, till now, has not featured well in nickel production. Indonesia is the world's largest nickel producer. However, miners there mostly use energy-intensive technology to extract the metal and engage in controversial waste disposal practices, including dumping waste rock in waterways. Talon's Minnesota project is a joint venture with Rio Tinto. It ensures a key U.S. source of the metal for Tesla battery factories in Texas and Nevada while reducing the company's supply lines at the same time. It is slated to begin by 2026.



Talon plans to use a technology that has the ability to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and chemically bind. This allows for permanent storage of the gas in rocks found inside Talon’s Tamarack project in northern Minnesota. The process, still under the testing phase, would empower Talon to market carbon-neutral nickel, which will be a big ticket for Tesla in the EV domain.



Tesla plans to buy 75,000 tons of nickel concentrate over the next six years, as well as smaller amounts of cobalt and iron ore, at London Metals Exchange-listed prices. However, it is unclear where Tesla will refine the nickel concentrate as the United States does not have a nickel refinery.



Last year the EV magnet had signed a similar nickel supply deal with BHP Group BHP in Australia to secure the supply of nickel from the latter’s Nickel West mine.



The alliance required Tesla and BHP Group to join forces to bring about a more efficient battery supply chain. The companies leveraged blockchain technology for raw-material procurement and production and identified supply-chain partners who are best aligned with their vision and battery value chains. BHP and TSLA have also partnered over sustainable solutions concerning energy storage targeting reduced carbon emissions.



Tesla’s commitment toward an EV-defined future and its aim for sustainability naturally make it the undisputed leader of EVs.



Tesla’s shares have risen 30.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s 7.8% growth.

23,2022-01-11,TSLA: 4 Stocks Cathie Wood Unloaded Last Week,"Cathie Wood has risen in the ranks of institutional investors, thanks to the stellar performance of her investment firm Ark Invest’s ETFs. Her strategy of investing in ‘disruptive innovations’ has led to high returns over the pandemic period. Her investment firm’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), has $23 billion in assets and has returned an average of nearly 45% annually over the past five years.

Moreover, Wood has forecasted that her firm’s strategies could deliver a 30-40% compound annual rate of return over the next five years. “Critical to investment success will be moving to the right side of change, avoiding industries and companies caught in the crosshairs of ‘creative destruction’ and embracing those on the leading edge of ‘disruptive innovation,” Wood stated earlier.

Based on Wood’s sound investment judgment, last week Ark ETFs shed the stocks of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TAK), and Twitter, Inc. (TWTR).

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)

This EV manufacturing behemoth does not need any introduction. TSLA sells EVs, electric generation systems, and storage systems globally. The company operates through the segments Automotive; and Energy Generation and Storage.

In September, Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, encouraged shareholders of TSLA to join a class-action lawsuit regarding the formal investigation underway about the company’s Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). The investigation was formally announced on August 16 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), following collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The company is also under investigation by several other law firms like Pomerantz LLP, the Schall Law Firm, and Glancy Prongay, and Murray LLP.

For the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, TSLA’s total cost of revenues increased 50.5% year-over-year to $10.10 billion. Total operating expenses rose 32.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.66 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, the company’s net cash provided by financing activities decreased 154.2% from the same period prior year to a negative $3.95 billion.

Street EPS estimate of $8.76 for the fiscal year 2022 indicates an increase of 39.9% from the prior year.

The stock has declined 7.9% over the past five days to close yesterday’s trading session at $1,058.12.

Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD)

PDD is an e-commerce platform operator headquartered in Shanghai, China. The company operates Pinduoduo, a mobile platform that offers products such as apparel, mother and child care products, fresh produce, electronic appliances, and furniture and household goods.

On November 26, PDD announced its plan to increase its research & development (R&D) and agricultural technology investment. The investment is expected to result in substantial cash outflow and might take some time before benefits can be materialized from the spending.

PDD’s revenue increased 51.3% year-over-year to $3.34 billion in the fiscal third quarter ended September 30. However, its total operating expenses also went up 4.6% from the same period prior year to $1.99 billion. Net cash used in investing activities rose 2,924.9% from the prior-year quarter to $2.14 billion.

The consensus revenue estimate of $4.82 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter indicates a 17% year-over-year rise.

Over the past year, the stock has declined 68.5% to close yesterday’s trading session at $56.99. It has declined 48.7% over the past six months.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TAK)

TAK researches, develops, manufactures, markets, and out-licenses pharmaceutical products worldwide. The company offers its products in gastroenterology, oncology, neuroscience, and rare diseases. It is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

On January 10, TAK announced that it would exercise its option to acquire Adaptate Biotherapeutics, an antibody-based therapeutics company. The acquisition might take some time before adding substantially to the company’s revenue stream.

For the six months ended September 30, TAK’s cost of sales increased 6% year-over-year to $4.64 billion. Net cash used in financial activities rose 57.4% from the prior-year six months to $5.91 billion. The company’s cash and cash equivalent balance stood at $5.45 billion, down 3.6% from the same period the prior year.

The street revenue estimate for the fiscal third quarter of $7.43 billion reflects a decrease of 6.3% from the prior-year quarter.

TAK’s shares have declined 22% over the past year and 14.9% over the past six months to close yesterday’s trading session at $14.24.

Twitter, Inc. (TWTR)

TWTR is a popular platform for public self-expression and real-time conversation. The company offers Twitter, a social media platform that allows users to consume, create, and distribute content.

On January 3, TWTR announced that on January 1, the company closed the sale of MoPub to AppLovin Corporation (APP). However, the company does not expect to recoup the total revenue loss of around $200 and $250 million associated with the sale of MoPub in 2022.

TWTR’s total costs and expenses increased 130.2% year-over-year to $2.03 billion in the fiscal third quarter ended September 30. Net income decreased 1,972.9% from the prior-year quarter to a negative $536.76 million, while net income per share came in at a negative $0.67, down 1,775% from the same period the prior year.

Although analysts expect TWTR’s revenue to increase 22.5% year-over-year to $1.58 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, its EPS is expected to decrease 7.9% from the prior-year quarter to $0.35 for the same period.

The stock has declined 22.4% over the past year and 42.1% over the past six months to close yesterday’s trading session at $39.97.

TSLA shares were trading at $1,062.92 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $4.80 (+0.45%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 0.58%, versus a -1.18% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

24,2022-01-11,Tesla Stock Price and Forecast: Why was TSLA stock up on Monday?,"Tesla stock flips from red to green on Monday as yields calm.

TSLA ends up closing just over 3% higher on Monday.

Tech stocks have suffered in early 2022.

Update: News out this morning that Tesla sold a record amount of Chinese-made vehicles since it opened its Shanghai plant in 2019. Data from the China Passenger Car Association showed Tesla sold 70,847 vehicles in December.

Tech stocks have not had the easiest start to 2022. With the background of inflation, rate hikes and rising yields, it may prove to be a more cautious year than the froth of 2021. While Tesla is not exactly pure tech, it does straddle the growth and tech sectors, both of which have started 2022 cautiously. The Fed funds futures are now pricing in a near 90% certainty of a rate hike in March. This was running at 50% at Christmas. Goldman is now penciling in four rate hikes for 2022, meaning every Fed meeting takes on more significance this year.

Tesla (TSLA) stock news

Now that we have finally gotten the question of ""will he/won't he sell more stock"" out of the way, it is back to relative normality for this one. Morgan Stanley certainly thinks so, as it raised its price target for Tesla to $1,300 on Monday afternoon. Also out on Monday was news of Tesla signing a deal with Talon Metals (TLO) for a tidy chunk of nickel. The deal is worth about $1.5 billion at current metal prices and adds to deals Tesla has put in place with the likes of BHP last year.

“The Talon team has taken an innovative approach to the discovery, development and production of battery materials, including to permanently store carbon as part of mine operations and the investigation of the novel extraction of battery materials,” said Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering at Tesla.

“This agreement is the start of an innovative partnership between Tesla and Talon for the responsible production of battery materials directly from the mine to the battery cathode."" said Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon.

Tesla (TSLA) stock forecast

The fine start to the year was quickly subsumed by a wave of investor rotation from tech and high growth to value. TSLA shares suffered four sharp loss days in a row after the initial surge on the first trading day of 2022. The medium-term trend is still lower with a lower high from the January 3 move failing to break the all-time high. However, the next confirmation would be taking out the low at $886. While Monday's recovery was strong intraday, it still stopped short of the 9 and 21-day moving averages. Look to these for signs the short-term trend is turning. Our short-tem pivot, therefore, is $1,080. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around the neutral 50 level, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is looking at a likely bearish crossover.

25,2022-01-11,"Tesla Stock Rises As China Sales Topped 70,000 In December","The China Passenger Car Association reported booming December electric vehicle sales on Tuesday, with record Tesla (TSLA) local deliveries. Tesla stock edged higher Tuesday, while China EV rivals rebounded solidly.

X

Tesla China sales hit 70,847 in December, with only 245 vehicles exported. Typically, Tesla reports its highest local deliveries in the third month of the quarter, when exports are low. Tesla sales were in line with some reports, but still represented a huge jump from the prior month.

In November, Tesla Shanghai sold 52,859 made-in-China Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, including 21,127 exported. Most of those exports go to Europe.

Tesla just got the OK to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin, as it awaits final approval to open the plant. The Berlin factory will eventually produce the bulk of Tesla's vehicles destined for European customers. But the production ramp may be slow and the plant will only make the Model Y to start.

New energy vehicle sales totaled 505,000, up 139% vs. a year earlier and 17.8% vs. November, the CPCA said. NEVs include fully electric , plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles. December EV sales totaled 423,000.

Tesla and many other EV makers likely got a boost in December, with China cutting EV subsidies by 30% in 2022. After 2022, Beijing plans to end subsidies.

Tesla's Blowout Q4

Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs in Q4 worldwide, crushing estimates. Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries included 296,850 Model 3 and Y vehicles and 11,750 Model S and X models. The U.S.-based EV maker delivered 936,172 vehicles in 2021.

Tesla has been able to largely avoid supply-chain issues due to chip shortages that have plagued other carmakers. Tesla has been able to do this by sourcing different chips and relying on in-house engineers to quickly rewrite software so they work.

China EV Startups

Meanwhile, Tesla's China-based rivals already reported strong December sales at the start of the month. EV and battery giant BYD (BYDDF) more than tripled December and full-year 2021 sales. Warren Buffett-backed BYD sold 93,945 new energy vehicles last month, a 225.7% surge from a year ago, and a 3% rise from November. For all of 2021, BYD sold 603,783 NEVs, up 218.3% from 2020.

Nio (NIO) sold 10,489 EVs in December, up nearly 50% from a year ago, but down slightly from November's 10,878.

Xpeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI) outsold Nio in December. Xpeng delivered 16,000 EVs last month, setting a new record. Deliveries spiked 181% vs. a year earlier. Li Auto sold 14,087 Li One hybrid SUVs in December, up 130% from last year.

Tesla Stock

Shares edged up 0.6% to 1,064.40 on the stock market today. On Monday, Tesla stock rose 3%, rebounding from solid intraday losses along with the Nasdaq. TSLA stock has a double-bottom 1202.05 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis.

Tesla's relative strength line is off highs, but hasn't broken down. However, its RS Rating remains high at 96 out of a best-possible 99. Its EPS Rating is 72.

China-based rivals Nio rose 3.8% on Tuesday, while Xpeng popped 7.3% and Li Auto jumped 8.2%. All three fell solidly Monday. BYD stock, which trades over the counter in the U.S., climbed 3.8% after sliding 1.5% on Monday.

26,2022-01-11,Tesla Loses Top-Ranking Black Executive,"Valerie Capers Workman, head of the company's human resources department, leaves as the company faces accusations of racism.

The electric vehicle corporate shuffle hit Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report Tuesday as the company's Valerie Capers Workman, head of human resources and one of its highest ranking black employees, left the company.

The timing of Workman's departure comes at a time when Tesla has faced multiple high-profile lawsuits of its treatment of black employees and subcontracted workers at the company's plant in Fremont, California.

“I am proud of all that I was able to accomplish at Tesla with the support of truly excellent colleagues, especially the People and Legal teams,” Workman said in an email cited by Bloomberg.

Workman, who will leave Tesla for career-placement firm Handshake at the end of the month, did not say anything disparaging about Tesla on her way out.

The EV car maker has been marred by controversy over the treatment of minorities.

In October, a federal jury in San Francisco ordered Tesla to pay nearly $137 million to a black elevator operator who accused the company of ignoring racial abuse that he faced while working at the company's factory in 2015 and 2016.

TheStreet Recommends: Tesla Loses Top-Ranking Black Executive

Owen Diaz said a supervisor and others and the factory repeatedly referred to him using racial slurs. Diaz reported seeing swastikas in the company's bathrooms and a racist effigy drawn around the office.

Other black employees complained about barriers to advancement. The company was the subject of at least two other lawsuits.

Tesla isn't the only EV company experiencing top-level departures.

Rivian (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive, Inc. Class A Report announced Monday that COO Rod Copes has left the company.

Rod began a phased retirement from Rivian several months ago, affording the team continuity as we moved toward production ramp.” Copes’ “duties have been absorbed by our leadership team,” the company added.

28,2022-01-11,"Rivian Started with Buy at Redburn, Lucid Neutral","By Sam Boughedda

Investing.com — Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) shares are up more than 4% Tuesday after Redburn analyst Charles Coldicott started the company's shares at a buy with a $141 fair value estimate. However, Coldicott also initiated Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) with a neutral rating.

Speaking on Rivian, the analyst told investors in a research note that he believes demand will ""outstrip Rivian's ability to produce"" while also describing the company's vehicles as having ""incredible acceleration given the vehicle size.""

Coldicott also noted that Rivian beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford and GM to market with its first electric pickup.

On Lucid, the analyst set a $39 fair value estimate, saying the company has a great product. Coldicott added that the company's powertrain technology ""surpasses"" Tesla in some aspects. However, the analyst said that Rivian is more directly competing with Tesla with its debut model, and therefore, he sees more significant risks.

Although Coldicott was more optimistic on Rivian's near to mid-term prospects, Lucid's shares have provided the best return on Tuesday with a 7% rise.

Jan 12 (Reuters) - Australian lithium miner Liontown Resources Ltd (LTR.AX)said on Wednesday it signed a deal to sell lithium spodumene from its flagship project to the battery unit of South Korea's LG Chem, sending its shares soaring 13%.

Liontown joins other lithium players in the country, like Vulcan Energy (VUL.AX), to strike major supply deals with EV makers as the sector assumes centre stage amid a global push by companies and governments towards a greener future.

The company also said the deal — a first for its Western Australia-based project — will account for nearly 30% of its annual output after year one of production and is expected to be operating from 2024.

32,2022-01-11,Ford Poised for More Gains as it Gears Up for Tesla Challenge,"The stock of Ford Motor Co. (F) - Get Ford Motor Company Report has the potential for more growth even after a stellar run in 2021, argues Stephen “Sarge” Guilfoyle.

Part of Ford’s potential lies in its leadership - with Jim Farley at the helm serving as CEO, he understands the needs of consumers, according to Guilfoyle.

“Farley is just a car guy,” Guilfoyle wrote recently on Real Money. “It is what he eats and sleeps. While many investors were tentatively invested in Ford because of the limited downside risk, Farley saw opportunity in a brand that still had a little something, that still meant something to the American consumer, and most of all... because he is a car guy, Farley understood that both legacy and electric automobile manufacturers had forgotten to build cars that regular people like.”

The company recently said it plans to nearly double the production of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup due to heavy demand from drivers.

“What is perhaps most interesting is that Ford is on the verge of winning market share,” Guilfoyle wrote, adding “75% of these reservations are not from Ford loyalists, but from individuals new to the Ford brand.""

Ford is planning to further ramp up production of EVs -- the company said it plans to invest over $30 billion in EV production facilities through 2025 alone.

With the entire auto industry running behind Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report in developing EV and battery technology, “the goal for now is to emerge as a clear cut number two North American electric vehicle manufacturer, and then ultimately take a run at the top spot,” Guilfoyle wrote. “Within two years, Ford expects to have the capacity to produce 600,000 battery electric vehicles per annum.”

Investors should be patient, Guilfoyle noted.

“Readers will see Ford attempting a breakout past a pivot created by a flat basing period of consolidation that came after a sharp rise in price,” he wrote. “I would then look for a more gradual appreciation in price that the name experienced this past autumn.”","The stock of Ford Motor Co.

In prepared remarks for his confirmation hearing testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell had said the country's post-pandemic recovery will be ""different in some respects"", but vowed to ""prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched"" in the world's largest economy.

Report CEO Jamie Dimon, with the first coming as early as March, a timeline Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Tuesday would be a ""reasonable possibility"".

X

Nineteen S&P 500 stocks, including Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA), already erased more than $1 trillion in market value in the week-long market sell-off from the Jan. 3 high, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith.

It's a harsh reminder of just how much damage is done to the market's rally in such a short period of time. Anyone jumping into the S&P 500 coming into this year is already taking a drubbing. Nearly a twentieth of the market's total gain from the pandemic low on March 23, 2020 through the Jan. 3, 2022 high is wiped out, says data from Wilshire Associates.

""Today is all about risk aversion as fears grow that financial markets completely misread the Fed's scramble to battle inflation,"" said Edward Moya, strategist at Oanda.com.

S&P 500 Pain Is Mounting Fast

The S&P 500's seemingly modest 3.1% drop from its 52-week high is masking much of the market's deeper pain.

Already, the average stock in the S&P 500 is down nearly 12% from its high. What does that mean? The typical S&P 500 is already in a correction. And that certainly didn't take long: The S&P 500 was at a high just a week ago.

And the dollar value of losses is getting tougher to ignore: $1.2 trillion. Astoundingly, though, just a handful of S&P 500 stocks account for nearly all of that pain. Much of it has to do with the fact the S&P 500's rises awarded many mega-companies with massive market caps. Tumbling from these heights was bound to get expensive.

Information Technology Losses Are Mounting

Nowhere else can you witness massive losses in this market as in S&P 500 information technology. Some of the losses are outstripping what many companies in the S&P 500 are worth.

Take Apple. Just a week ago, investors were celebrating its value surpassing $3 trillion on an intraday basis. The company's value vaulted more than $2 trillion from the market's low to its high. And yet, S&P 500 analysts warned the run was too far, too fast. They said no S&P 500 company, including Apple, will finish the year valued at $3 trillion.

And they're looking right, now. Shares of Apple are down more than 5% from the day the S&P 500 hit its high on Jan. 3. That decline wiped away more than $173 billion for Apple. Sure, the stock is still up more than 200% from the 2020 low. And it's still worth $2.8 trillion. And yet, the decline is swift and big. Should you buy Apple stock now?

Microsoft stock is down even more, 6.1%, from the S&P 500's high point. That's enough to knock its value down more than $150 billion. It's making an even more serious breach: Shares of Microsoft are down more than 10% from their 52-week high to 314.27, putting them into a correction. And yet, analysts still see the company as worth $2.4 trillion. They're calling for Microsoft's shares to rise nearly 20% in the next 52 weeks to 374.90.

Tesla's Short-Circuiting

It's not just the big tech stocks serving up massive losses, though. Electric-car maker Tesla is one of just three S&P 500 companies to shed more than $140 billion in market value from the S&P 500's high.

Shares of Tesla, soaring into the year on strong shipment data, are now down nearly 15% from their 52-week high. And the stock is off nearly 12% just since the S&P 500's high. That crumbling in value is enough to wipe away $142.6 billion, taking its market value down to $1.1 trillion. Analysts, though, see more pain on the way. They think shares of Tesla, which closed Monday at 1,058.12 will be more than 10% lower in 12 months.

It's fair to point out all these losses are a fraction of what investors are still up. The U.S. market's value is still up more than $26 trillion from the March 2020 low, Wilshire says. Still, the recent trend is ringing a trillion-dollar warning bell.

37,2022-01-11,Dow Jones Gains As Powell Makes This Inflation Pledge; Tesla Offers Opportunity; GE Stock Rallies,"The Dow Jones gained as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell made an inflation pledge. Tesla (TSLA) stock carved out a new entry, while Rivian Automotive (RIVN) advanced on a new analyst rating. General Electric (GE) also jumped on new coverage. Apple (AAPL) and Boeing (BA) were among the top blue chips, while Illumina (ILMN) exploded.

X

A couple of stocks managed to pass buy points amid the positive action. Apache parent APA (APA) and steel stock ArcelorMittal (MT) both tested entries.

Fed Chair Powell Makes Inflation Pledge

Fed Chairman Powell gave the stock market a boost after he struck a hawkish, yet measured, tone during his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday.

He insisted that there will be a return to normal supply conditions in 2021 but underlined the point he will not be afraid to use his toolbox to tackle rising prices amid a mismatch between supply and demand.

""If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected (and) we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will,"" he said.

The central bank lowers rates to boost demand and spur growth. It also raises them to cool the economy and curb demand.

Yields fell following Powell's testimony. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped about 3 basis points to 1.75%.

Nasdaq Rallies, Growth Stocks Jump

The Nasdaq had a solid session, closing up 1.4%. Illumina was the top stock here, rising 17%. It was boosted after issuing 2022 revenue guidance that topped analyst views.

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 36251.76 +182.89 +0.51 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 4713.10 +42.81 +0.92 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 15153.45 +210.62 +1.41 Russell 2000 (IWM) 217.49 +2.17 +1.01 IBD 50 (FFTY) 42.26 +0.55 +1.32 Last Update: 4:06 PM ET 1/11/2022

The S&P 500 also moved higher, ending the day up 0.9%. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) was among the standouts here, gaining 6.6%.

The S&P 500 sectors were mostly positive. Technology and energy were the leaders, while consumer staples and utilities lagged most.

Small caps were also boosted amid the encouraging action. The Russell 2000 closed up 1%.

Growth stocks also gave the bears a bloody nose, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY), a bellwether for growth stocks, up 1.3%.

Dow Jones Up As Boeing, Apple Stock Gain

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also squeezed out a gain. It closed up 0.5% as it rose 183 points.

Apple stock was among the best performers. It rose almost 2% and remains extended from a cup-with-handle buy point of 153.27.

But it was Boeing that led the upside on the Dow Jones today. The aerospace giant closed up 3.2%. It remains stuck below its 200-day line for now, though.

IBM (IBM) was the worst index laggard, falling nearly 2%.

IBM stock was punished after UBS downgraded it from neutral to sell. Procter & Gamble (PG) closed down just over 1%.

Tesla Stock Offers New Entry; RIVN Pops

EV leader Tesla closed up 0.6% and is now offering up a new buy point. The entry at 1,208.10 is due to a new handle, which is deeper than usual due to recent volatile market conditions. It comes after a breakout past a double-bottom base buy point of 1,202.05 failed. Tesla stock has given up all of its gains, and more, after clearing a trendline entry last week. But if the positive market action continues, it could soon retake this level. Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4. The stock now sits almost 15% below this level. It remains up more than 30% over the past 12 months, however. TSLA stock is a member of the prestigious IBD Leaderboard list of top growth stocks. Meanwhile, Rivian stock closed up 2.6%. The EV stock was boosted after Redburn initiated coverage with a buy rating. Despite today's progress, it remains down more than 3% for the week. It is also more than 50% off its all-time high of 179.47.

GE Stock Jumps On This, Eyes Key Level

General Electric stock popped higher after investment bank Bernstein initiated coverage. It closed the session up 2.4%.

GE stock is currently in the midst of a consolidation. It remains well shy of its ideal buy point of 116.27, MarketSmith analysis shows.

Both earnings and stock market performance are far from ideal. But there are positive technical signs.

It is now back above its 50-day moving average. It is also closing in on its 200-day moving average, while the relative strength line is also picking up slightly.

Bernstein highlighted the possible benefits of its being turned into three separate businesses. The firm said its component parts are ""easily scalable public companies."" It also said that ""improved line of sight to financials and end markets"" will benefit shareholders.

These Stocks Pass Buy Points

Apache parent APA closed out of its buy range after sprinting past a cup-without-handle entry of 28.73. This is a second stage pattern, which IBD research finds are more likely to succeed.

The relative strength line sprang to a new high, which is another positive.

Energy stocks in general have been doing well as economies look to get on track following the coronavirus pandemic.

Steel play ArcelorMittal closed in its buy zone after moving above an ideal entry of 34.98.

One issue is company earnings, which are not ideal. But big money has been buying shares of late and it is in the top 10% of stocks in terms of market performance over the past 12 months.

With the market uptrend still currently under pressure it is not advisable to buy new stocks at the current time.

It is worth keeping a close tab on stocks performing well under these conditions and add them to one's watchlist, however.

39,2022-01-12,"Tesla Stock: Path To $2,500 By 2025 (NASDAQ:TSLA)","jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images

Earlier this month, Tesla (TSLA) announced excellent vehicle production and deliveries numbers. The company crushed consensus deliveries estimates by a whopping 16%. However, the company's share price slumped after the blockbuster report due to a broad market selloff. Tesla will report fourth quarter revenues and EPS in a couple of weeks, and while many analysts raised their forecast, I believe that the company can still beat consensus figures. Moreover, the company should continue to guide higher and report better than anticipated numbers as we advance in 2022 and beyond. Therefore, the company's stock price will likely move higher into earnings and should move on to new ATHs after the report. Additionally, Tesla's stock price should push substantially higher over the next several years as the company advances into the future.

Tesla's Post-Deliveries Report Selloff

You would think that after such a blockbuster report, the company's stock price would fly higher and break out to new ATHs. However, that was not the case here. We saw an initial jump to $1,200, but a sharp reversal briefly knocked shares to below $1,000. It's important to note that this abrupt correction of around 20% essentially began when the Fed's hawkish minutes came over the wire. Therefore, the recent pullback in the stock was not Tesla related but resulted from a broader stock market decline. Now that market conditions appear to have stabilized, the company's stock should recover and proceed higher into Q4 earnings. Provided that the stock market continues to stabilize here, I expect Tesla's shares to break out to new ATHs following the upcoming earnings announcement.

Tesla's Blockbuster Numbers

Tesla delivered 308,600 total vehicles last quarter, a whopping 72% increase over last year. This report considerably topped consensus estimates for 267,000 total vehicles. Tesla's stellar results indicate that demand for its cars remains highly robust. Moreover, the company's production capacity continues to expand, implying that Tesla's revenues should grow substantially in future years.

Tesla Production and deliveries Tesla.com

Tesla's full-year numbers (936,172 total vehicles) illustrate how close the company came to selling one million cars last year. In total, the company's 2021 deliveries surpassed the previous year's results by a staggering 87%. In Q4, the company sold 11,750 Model S/X vehicles and 296,850 Model 3/Y cars.

Tesla Worldwide Deliveries 2016-2021

Tesla worldwide deliveries Statista.com

We see the phenomenal YoY growth in Tesla deliveries here. Remarkably, Tesla's deliveries have surged by more than 1,100% over the last five years. Given the company's past performance and rapid anticipated growth, we should continue to see substantial delivery increases in future years. Therefore, we should continue to see higher levels in Tesla's stock price as the company advances.

What To Expect From Q4 Earnings

Last quarter, my EPS estimate was off by one cent. So, let's see if we can hit the bullseye this time. The company delivered 11,750 Model S/X vehicles, of which 17% were subject to lease accounting. Therefore, Tesla sold around 9,753 cars in its Model S/X segment last quarter. Tesla's Model S/X segment average selling price (""ASP"") has increased recently. Thus, we will apply an ASP of $115K for the Model S/X segment. Using this ASP provides us with an approximate $1.12 billion in revenues for Tesla's luxury upscale segment.

In the Model 3/Y segment, leasing accounted for about 5% of deliveries. Therefore, last quarter, Tesla sold roughly 282,000 vehicles in its Model 3/Y unit. Implementing an ASP of $50K implies that Tesla derived approximately $14.1 billion in revenues from the Model 3/Y segment last quarter. Once we approximate Tesla's revenues, gross margin, and expenses in other businesses, we can estimate what the company should deliver in revenues and EPS for the fourth quarter.

Tesla Q3 vs. Q4 Estimates

Tesla Q4 projections The Author

Provided Tesla's deliveries numbers and my ASP estimates, we arrived at $15.3 billion in revenues for Models S/3/X/Y sales alone. Once we added $450 million in leasing and $400 million in regulatory credit revenues, we came up to $16.15 billion in total automotive sales revenues. After we computed energy generation and storage plus Tesla's services and other segments, we arrived at an $18 billion revenue figure for Q4.

While my revenue estimate is notably higher than the current $16.31 billion consensus number, my revenue figure is still lower than some higher-end calls that exceed $18.25 billion. If Tesla meets consensus figures, it will be a 52% YoY rise in revenues, and if the company meets my projections, we will see a 68% YoY surge in sales.

Revenue Estimates

Tesla Revenue Estimates SeekingAlpha.com

We see that many analysts expect robust double-digit revenue growth to continue in future quarters and years. However, many analyst figures are still relatively low to what the company will likely achieve. After all, we continuously see upward revisions in Tesla's revenue and EPS estimates, and this trend will likely continue as the company progresses.

EPS Revisions

Tesla EPS Revisions SeekingAlpha.com

In previous articles, I've mentioned that analysts have often been asleep at the wheel on Tesla. Although EPS estimates have increased notably in recent years, there should be plenty of room for upward revisions in the future.

EPS Estimates

Tesla EPS Estimates SeekingAlpha.com

We see a wide range of EPS estimates for Q4, and in general, for Tesla. The mid-range is $2.28, while higher-end estimates go all the way up to around $3. My EPS estimate is $2.66, which is about 17% above consensus figures, representing a 233% YoY EPS increase.

The Bottom Line

Tesla has shown a tenacity for surpassing analyst estimates in recent quarters. The company has exceeded consensus expectations by an average of 14% in its last four quarters, and this trend of outperformance will likely continue. Moreover, Tesla delivered a much better than anticipated production and deliveries report for the fourth quarter. The results suggest that Tesla should provide more substantial Q4 revenues than many analysts envision. The revenue increase should translate to a better than anticipated EPS result, reflecting positively on Tesla's stock price. I expect Tesla to post revenues of around $18 billion with an EPS of about $2.66. This dynamic should enable Tesla's stock price to move to new ATHs. Moreover, as Tesla grows revenues and expands EPS in future years, its stock price should appreciate considerably.

Here is what Tesla's financials could look like in future years:

Year 2022 2023 2024 2025 Revenue $79B $101B $126B $154B Revenue growth 28% 25% 22% 20% EPS $13 $17 $22 $28 Forward P/E 88 80 75 70 Price $1,500 $1,760 $2,100 $2,500

Source: Author's Material

My higher EPS and share price appreciation estimates are more aggressive than my prior analyses. However, we see Tesla performing and delivering better than expected. Furthermore, I was overly conservative in my EPS projections in previous articles. Tesla could provide close to $30 in EPS in 2025, and even if we lower the company's forward P/E multiple substantially, we still arrive at a notably higher stock price than we see now. If Tesla continues delivering and surpassing analysts' expectations, I expect the company's stock price to be around $2,500 in 2025.

Risks To Tesla

Risks exist for Tesla, and there are quite a few. While I estimate that the company can earn close to $30 per share in 2025, the company is very far from such figures right now. Therefore, there's the risk that Tesla will not illustrate the kind of earnings growth I envision. A slowdown in demand, increased competition, supply issues, decreased growth, and other variables are all risks we should consider before betting on Tesla to grow EPS several-fold through 2025. Serious concerns could cause Tesla's valuation to lose altitude, and the company's share price could even head in reverse if any serious issues should arise. Therefore, one should consider the risks carefully before committing any capital to a Tesla investment.","Therefore, the company's stock price will likely move higher into earnings and should move on to new ATHs after the report.

40,2022-01-12,Tesla stock is 'a confidence gauge' for markets: Strategist,"Tesla (TSLA) is a ""barometer"" of market confidence, says TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan. ""This is a name that really is a confidence gauge in my opinion,"" Kinahan told Yahoo Finance Live.

""If it gets down near the $950-ish level, you'll see clients coming in and buy it up until it gets to about $1,050. When it gets above $1,050, it seems to make clients a little be nervous, so the amount of buying there starts to dissipate a little bit.""

Shares of the electric vehicle giant were up more than 4% on Wednesday, despite a hot inflation print.

""This is my barometer, so to speak, of people who are more confident in the market. And then when people are a little more nervous the two names we look to are Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT),"" said Kinahan.

""These are blue chip, so to speak, stocks but also have that growth component when things are going well,"" he added.

The increasing probability of higher Fed rate hikes didn't deter investors from putting money in technology stocks during Wednesday's session.

""In December our clients took less exposure to the markets than they had all year,"" said Kinahan.

""Earlier this week you started to see how quickly that sentiment can change and people coming in to buy the dip,"" he said.

Last week, growth stocks came under pressure following a more hawkish tone from Federal Reserve minutes.

On Monday, some of the big cap tech and internet stocks opened lower but finished the session either flat or higher.

Despite the recent volatility, some strategists still point to growth stocks with healthy balance sheets.

""As economic conditions start to slow down, you do need to see balance sheets very, very strong,"" Principal Global Investors Chief Strategist Seema Shah told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week.

""Although this is quite a challenging time, we do still have some faith in mega-cap tech names, especially from a stability perspective for your portfolio,"" she added.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will hold its Q4 and Full Year 2021 earnings call on Wednesday, January 26, 2022. As usual, Tesla will send out a brief advisory before the call with a link to a Q4 and Full Year 2021 update. The live question and answer webcast will start at around 4:30 p.m. Central Time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time).

In November 2021, Elon Musk also stated he would provide an updated product roadmap at the Q4 and FY 2021 earnings call. Tesla still has a few products customers are eager to know more about, particularly the Cybertruck and Semi.

For example, PepsiCo is expected to receive its first batch of Tesla Semi deliveries at the end of this month. Musk might provide a more solid timeframe for Semi deliveries and Tesla’s progress on Class 8 truck’s production at the upcoming earnings call.

As for the Cybertruck, Tesla had previously stated that it already produced a few alpha prototypes of the all-electric pickup. A few people have already spotted the Cybertruck alpha prototypes in the wild a few times.

Tesla reported producing 305,840 vehicles during Q4 2021. It delivered a total of 308,600 cars in the fourth quarter. Tesla made a total of 930,422 cars in 2021. It was very close to achieving 1 million deliveries last year with a total of 936,172 vehicles.

A Tesla product roadmap would provide details on the company’s plans moving forward. 2022 is likely to be a big year for Tesla, especially considering its plans to produce vehicles at Giga Texas and Giga Berlin. Giga Shanghai also plans to increase production capacity with an RMB 1.2B ($188 million) expansion project.

New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu believes the electric vehicle (EV) maker's investors are in store for sizable rewards. He expects Tesla's stock price to soar more than 40% to $1,580 per share in the year ahead, fueled by production increases and improving profitability.

Ferragu says Tesla's new manufacturing facilities in Texas and Berlin will help it ramp its production to an annual rate of 1.8 million vehicles by the end of this year. He also predicts that Tesla's operational improvements will allow it to generate $0.30 of gross profit for every $1 in sales in 2022.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also had positive things to say about Tesla. He expects the EV leader to continue to drive the auto market's growth in the coming years.

The shift from gas-powered to electric vehicles represents ""the biggest transformation to the auto industry since the 1950s,"" according to Ives. ""It's a $5 trillion market opportunity,"" he said during an interview with Yahoo Finance.

Like Ferragu, Ives expects Tesla's new plants to quickly boost the number of EVs it can supply to eager customers. This rapid rise in the company's manufacturing capabilities combined with booming demand for its vehicles in markets like China and the U.S. should fuel additional gains in Tesla's sales and profits, according to Ives. In turn, he sees Tesla's share price climbing roughly 27% to $1,400.

Now what

Tesla is facing intensifying competition from the likes of Ford, GM, and Lucid as well as a host of Chinese automakers. However, the EV market represents a massive growth opportunity for Tesla and its rivals. There's likely to be more than one winner in this booming industry, and Tesla is well positioned to be one of them.","He expects Tesla's stock price to soar more than 40% to $1,580 per share in the year ahead, fueled by production increases and improving profitability.

43,2022-01-12,Tesla Brandenburg (TSLA): Volume Production Is Still Months Away,"jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images

Followers of Tesla (TSLA) stock might be wondering when the new factory in Brandenburg, Germany will be coming online. After missing the original July 2021 date, Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave a new forecast for the end of December. That date has come and gone, and the factory still does not have a construction permit and although many analysts include Brandenburg production in their sales forecasts for Q1, there is no firm date for a start-up.

In this article, I take a look at the permitting situation and the status of the work on the site and reach the conclusion that volume production is unlikely before the second half of this year.

The permit to build the factory

The latest predictions from the German press are suggesting a possible date of the end of January for Tesla to finally be awarded a permit to construct the Brandenburg factory.

Although Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he was hopeful of acquiring a ""permit to start production” last October, it appears that Tesla did not submit all the required documentation until late December, and delays in approval are at least partially a result of late submission of data.

Experts are currently reviewing the latest documents submitted by Tesla; this review is the final stage of the permitting process. The areas of concern appear to be the potential for pollution and the measures taken to prevent spills and discharges of untreated waste. Once the experts submit their reports, if satisfactory, the authorities will be able to issue a permit.

Tesla’s plant is located directly over a drinking water aquifer that supplies water to the area, and environmental groups claim that the amount of water allocated to the factory may result in a drinking water shortage. Two environmental groups have challenged the award of a water use permit, claiming that the granting of that permit was illegal. That case is now making its way through the Frankfurt courts with no assigned date for a hearing. It is not clear whether this court challenge will delay the final permit.

Temporary permits

Tesla is proceeding with construction based on a series of interim permits granted for parts of the work. Construction has moved forward based on those partial permits, and some of the factory equipment is now being tested, also based on interim, limited permits.

Tesla was granted an operating permit to test the stamping plant last September, and visitors to the plant saw the stamping operation in action during the October open day.

In late October another permit was granted to run operational tests on the paint shop (up to 250 vehicle bodies) and to test the casting machines over a period of 60 days. That permit also included permission to use a temporary hazardous materials store and temporary utilities and water treatment systems.

On January 7th, Tesla was granted another permit to continue the tests as follows (the referenced document is in German, the following is a brief summary with assistance from Google translate):

Permit to test:

Stamping – Maximum 6,000 parts per week, 26,000 total

Paint shop and Body in White– Up to 500 car bodies per week, 2,000 total

Final assembly – continue performance testing, no specified throughput. This is probably testing and calibration rather than actual assembly.

The permit is granted subject to certain conditions, including:

The test period is extended for a maximum of 8 weeks, which works out to 250 car bodies per week if the stated maximum is reached during the eight-week time frame.

The permit includes the continued operation of temporary utilities.

Tesla must submit schedules for each week of testing and report on the materials used and the emissions.

Tesla is not permitted to use any of the parts and bodies made during the test period in saleable vehicles. Documentation and proof of disposal are mandated.

Liquid wastes must be analyzed, and certified proof of disposal is required for hazardous waste.

The extension to the test period was requested by Tesla because the “parts and/or bodies joined as part of the system tests have a poor quality that deviates significantly from the specifications”.

The German authorities appear to be doing whatever they can to allow Tesla to proceed with construction and testing at the Brandenburg factory. However, they do not appear to yield when it comes to pollution control, water treatment, and hazardous materials.

Award of a permit does not mean production will start

Although permitting has been put forward as the reason why the plant didn’t start up on time, it is clear from videos taken at the site and posted on YouTube, that a lot of work remains to be done before the plant can reach volume production.

Paint Shop

The paint shop is operating with temporary services including compressors and a temporary process water cooling system that has been installed outside one of the doors of the main building. The photo below shows the temporary installations:

Temporary Utilities at the Paint Shop YouTube

Before the paint shop can be operated in its final configuration, the pipes that are running down the wall must be relocated to the adjacent pipe rack and across to the central utility building, which is not yet complete.

There is a similar but smaller arrangement of compressors and coolers outside the stamping plant.

Central Utility Building

The central utility building is itself still under construction, as shown in the photo below:

Central Utility Building YouTube

At the far end, you can see the process water coolers, they have been placed on their foundation, but none of the piping is installed. They sit outdoors adjacent to the central utility building.

In the foreground is the foundation for the central utility building; construction of the building structure has not started. Equipment to be installed inside the building includes chillers, air compressors, air dryers, and hot water boilers, all of which are essential to the operation of the factory. Two stacks have recently been erected to take the waste gas from the boilers, but so far none of the equipment in the area has been installed.

Water treatment plant

Adjacent to the central utility building is the water treatment plant, shown below:

Water Treatment Plant YouTube

Work on this area is barely started. Eventually, this building will house tanks, filters, and other equipment for the treatment of water from the paint shop skid cleaning process, the casting quench tank, the finished car leak tests, and other areas of the plant.

Permits issued in October mention that Tesla had to submit a revised design for the water-treatment plant. I believe that submission was part of the documentation handed over in December which is currently being reviewed. Some work on the water treatment plant building was allowed to start in November but completion is very likely delayed pending approval of the final design.

Miscellaneous incomplete areas

There is an extensive system of drains, retention ponds, settling basins, and pumping stations for dealing with stormwater at the site. This has been under construction for several months but is a long way from completion.

Part of the stormwater management system YouTube

Other areas that are visibly incomplete

The main building heating system is not functioning yet. Some heating and cooling units have been installed on the roof, but ducting is not complete. Temporary heaters are installed at various locations outside the doors of the building, blowing heated air inside.

Similarly, there is no heat in the drive unit building, which also appears to have no services. The pipe rack to the building is empty and it is unlikely that drive units can be made at this time.

A piling machine has recently appeared on-site in the area of the extended stamping plant, work on the extension may be starting soon. Tesla’s schedule submitted last July indicated a six-month time frame for construction of that section of work.

The hazardous materials warehouse has not been started. This is a 3,000 sq. m. building for the storage of hazardous input materials and hazardous wastes. Handling of hazardous materials is thought to be a subject of the documents currently under review and the delay in constructing those facilities is probably permit-related. Tesla has been operating a temporary hazardous material store while they have been testing the paint shop and casting facilities. However, a permanent facility will likely be required before the plant can start volume production.

The fire station building has not been started. It is a three-story building as shown below:

Proposed Fire Station Tesla Documents Submitted for Approval

Videos of the construction site show an area that resembles a building site, not a finished factory. There are temporary storage structures and more tents than a boy scout jamboree. The area is littered with construction materials, piles of dirt, earth-moving equipment, cranes, trailers, and temporary offices. Roads, outdoor lighting, and parking areas are partially complete but a lot of work remains to be done.

Completion is months away

Tesla fans will no doubt remember the “start of production” of the Model 3, when Tesla rolled a hand-built car off the end of a fake production line for a publicity stunt six months before the real production line was finished. We might see something similar at Brandenburg once the building permit is issued. No doubt the award of the final permit will be accompanied by a fanfare of publicity and a sharp upward move in Tesla's share price, but it does not signal the start of production.

Given the rigorous procedures for verification of safety and pollution control systems in the factory, I don’t imagine the authorities will be keen to allow real production to start without the water treatment plant, the hazardous materials store, and possibly the fire station. Those buildings are 4 to 6 months away from completion, assuming there are no more permitting delays.

I don’t expect to see meaningful sales from the Brandenburg plant until the latter half of the year. What that means for Tesla’s stock price is harder to predict. I see some bearish factors influencing the price in 2022.

Delays in starting Brandenburg mean that Tesla sales could lag in Q1 and Q2

BEVs will see margin pressures in 2022 from rising costs of input materials (Lithium prices have risen 500% since early last year, Nickel and Copper prices are higher, battery prices are trending upwards). However, legacy manufacturers will be reluctant to raise prices because they need BEV sales to meet their emission targets, competition will intensify.

Production costs at Brandenburg are likely to be higher than Shanghai, even after transportation costs and import duties, and ramp-up costs in the second half of the year, at both Brandenburg and Austin, could put further pressure on Tesla’s margins

However, the biggest influence on Tesla's stock price will probably come from a general movement of the market and a pullback in the prices of last year's big gainers as the Federal Reserve tightens the money supply.

Tesla shares have had a strong run-up, but there is no realistic scenario that can justify their current valuation. Perhaps it is time for those who have enjoyed the ride up to follow the example of Tesla's CEO, and take some profits off the table.","That permit also included permission to use a temporary hazardous materials store and temporary utilities and water treatment systems.

47,2022-01-12,Tesla leading auto world's 'biggest transformation since the 1950s': Wedbush's Ives,"Tesla (TSLA) strong rally this week points to more gains ahead, according to Wedbush, with the U.S. electric vehicle maker primed to transform the auto industry after ending 2021 on a strong note.

Better-than expected fourth quarter delivery figures spurred investors to remain bullish on Tesla's stock, while the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s new Gigafactory in Austin, Texas preps for production this month.

“We're seeing, it's a $5 trillion market opportunity in terms of EV and it's the biggest transformation to the auto industry since the 1950s,"" Dan Ives, Wedbush’s senior equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.

However, Tesla's bull case going forward ""continues to be expanding supply,” he added. “Based on all of our work in and around Austin, we think starting next week we're going to get into the early stages of what I believe are cars rolling off the plant,” Ives said.

While there’s been no formal announcement of the Austin factory opening, all eyes are there and on Berlin, opportunities some analysts view could expand capacity for the EV manufacturer. Wall Street is expecting an update on the company’s conference call later on this month.

“When you look at Austin in particular, it's been very smooth in terms of the build out,” Ives said.

“Hiring has been very strong over the last few months, and that's why Musk has made such a bet on Austin in terms of that being really the golden jewel of the ecosystem,” the analyst added.

Tesla walks a 'tight rope'

Meanwhile, Tesla’s sales numbers for December in China showed another record month of deliveries. The data confirm that almost half of Tesla’s record year of production and deliveries came from GigaFactory Shanghai.

Tesla sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday. Only 245 units were exported to other markets.

Story continues

The automaker, which has been able to surmount supply chain woes experienced by rivals to post record quarterly deliveries, has seen a changing tide in China after recent backlash over the company’s showroom in China’s Xinjiang– a region at the center of U.S. genocide allegations.

Like other analysts, Ives believes China remains a growth opportunity for Tesla, expecting China to be “over 40% of deliveries for Tesla in 2022.”

China’s EV market is dominated by domestic brands, including BYD and Wuling – a local marque that’s part of General Motors (GM). According to Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility, Tesla is only the foreign brand in the top 10.

“It's a tight rope in terms of China,” Ives said. “But if you look at what's happening right now, the China growth story is actually accelerating for Tesla 2022, and that we believe is worth about $500 per share of the story. It's something we believe is underestimated by the Street.”

Wedbush maintains an “outperform” rating on the stock, with a $1,400 price target and bull price target of $1,800.

And while more competitors jump into the EV space, Ives argued it's “not a zero sum game” for Tesla.

“Ford's gonna be successful at GM, Lucid, VW in Europe and of course, NIO in China, but overall in EV land is Tesla's world,"" the analyst explained. ""Everyone else is paying rent at this point and that's what we're seeing"" in the near term, Ives added.

48,2022-01-12,TSLA taps Fabian Tan to lead strategic insights agency JUNK,"The Secret Little Agency (TSLA) has appointed Fabian Tan as partner of JUNK, its strategic insights agency and cultural bureau. This comes as JUNK looks to expand into a service cultural strategy agency to ensure deeper regional foresight and fluency for clients across Southeast Asia. Tan is trained as a qualitative researcher and brand consultant with Quantum Consumer Solutions, first in Singapore and eventually moving to Shanghai to set up and co-lead its China presence in 2017.

According to JUNK, Tan adopts a method-agnostic approach to applied human sciences, and believes in reimagining conventional research ""rules"" to deliver interesting yet useful outcomes for clients. As such, he has applied his specialisation in cultures and insights for brand strategy, innovation, purpose-building and communication across various verticals, including personal care, beauty, F&B, nutrition and supplements, alcohol, social issues and sustainability. His experience and partnerships are anchored in Asia and the global South.

TSLA launched JUNK in 2018, as an editorial and research desk to better understand the vibrant cultural landscape of Southeast Asia for readers and brands. Where cultural economics meets speculative design, JUNK aims to help clients achieve a deep understanding of Southeast Asia’s unique and diverse cultures - often superficially understood or overlooked - to unlock sharper strategies that can achieve desired business outcomes. JUNK has already begun work for a variety of client brands, including most recently the Potato Head Group, and currently has open roles and is actively hiring curious, inquisitive cultural thinkers.

“Asian Excellence - that’s how I’ve always seen TSLA. And I’m thrilled to now be a part of this mission focussed agency and to work alongside some of the brightest, most daring, and passionate thinkers, creatives, and problem solvers,” said Tan.

He added that JUNK will further deepen this ethos, as it fortifies its offer by studying Asian cultures more deeply and empathetically. ""We want to tell cultural stories that are real, raw, nuanced, and inspiring, and have set our sights on decoding the complexities and excavating the (thus far) inaccessible aspects of our region. I’m excited to be on this journey, and to see the magic and impact we can create with JUNK’s robust cultural insights function within the TSLA ecosystem,"" he explained.

Separately, TSLA beefed up its team last year with three key hires across departments: Rachel Tan as its second head of mothering, Brandon Ellison as content creator for T-Studios, and Kifaya Taha as its senior strategist. Managing partner Sorcha John said previously that adding talented and passionate people to its leadership table ensures that both its future direction and the work it creates is continually elevated and challenged by new voices, new perspectives and new abilities.

The year 2021 also saw the rebranding of TSLA Design to Anak. Moving forward, the design arm now focuses on branding and design development of brands rolled out at scale regionally or globally from Singapore.

NEW DELHI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is ""still working through a lot of challenges with the government"" in India, its billionaire chief executive Elon Musk said on Twitter on Thursday, responding to a question on when it would launch its electric cars in the country.

Tesla had plans to begin selling imported cars in India last year and has been lobbying the government to slash import taxes on electric vehicles (EVs) before it enters the market. In October, it took its demands to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office.

Musk didn't identify the ""challenges"" being worked on in his Twitter post.

The Indian market for premium EVs is still in its infancy and charging infrastructure is scarce. Just 5,000 of the 2.4 million cars sold in India last year were electric, of which a handful were luxury models.

India levies an import duty of as high as 100% on imported cars, including EVs, which Musk has previously said are among the highest in the world. Analysts have said that at these rates Tesla cars would become too costly for many buyers, crimping sales.

Tesla's demands for tax cuts - first reported by Reuters in July - have prompted objections from several local players, who say such a move would deter investment in domestic manufacturing.

Indian government officials are also divided over the U.S. automaker's demands. Some officials want the company to commit to local manufacturing before considering any tax breaks, but Tesla has indicated it first wants to experiment with imports.

Even as Tesla is holding out for a cut in import duties, luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz will start assembling the electric version of its flagship S-Class sedan, the EQS, in India later this year.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Jan 12 (Reuters) - California is evaluating whether Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) self-driving tests require regulatory oversight, following ""videos showing a dangerous use of that technology"" and federal investigations into Tesla vehicle crashes, a state regulator said.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles had said that Tesla’s “full self-driving,” or FSD, beta requires human intervention and therefore is not subject to its regulations on autonomous vehicles.

But the agency is ""revisiting that decision following recent software updates, videos showing a dangerous use of that technology, open investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the opinions of other experts,"" the department said in a letter on Friday to Lena Gonzalez, chair of the state Senate Transportation Committee.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The Los Angeles Times first reported the letter.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The electric car company has been expanding the rollout of what it describes as the ""beta"" of its advanced driver assistant software, FSD, sparking safety concerns by effectively allowing untrained drivers to test how well the technology works on public roads.

Critics say Tesla was able to avoid state regulatory oversight by telling the Department of Motor Vehicles that its FSD features do not make its cars autonomous.

The department said it has notified Tesla that it ""will be initiating further review of the technology of their vehicles, including any expansion of the current programs or features.""

""If the capabilities of the features meet the definition of an autonomous vehicle according to California law and regulations, DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits,"" the agency said in a statement.

Under the regulation, Tesla would need to report crashes and traffic tickets specific to the FSD, said Phil Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania.

This would also ""trigger a driver background check to ensure (a) good driving record,"" he said.

Currently, regulations cover companies like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N), which are testing autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in California.

The FSD allows vehicles to perform some driving tasks such as lane changes, but Tesla says the features ""require a fully attentive driver."" Still, Tesla markets the technology as ""full self-driving"" and charges up to $10,000 for the software.

The DMV also said its review of Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving” is continuing.

""The DMV shares the concern held by many other safety stakeholders about the potential for driver inattention, misunderstanding, or misuse as these systems become more prevalent,"" it said.

The S&P 500 sectors ended the day nearly all positive. Materials, consumer discretionary and technology fared best. Health care was the only laggard.

Small caps fought back from lows, with the Russell 2000 closing down 0.7%.

However growth stocks managed to give the bears a black eye, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY), a bellwether for growth stocks, up 1%.

Microsoft Stock, Salesforce.com Lead Dow Jones

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged most out of the major indexes. It still closed with a modest gain of 0.1%, though.

Microsoft was one of the top performers on the Dow Jones today. It closed up 1.1%. The IBD Leaderboard stock has fallen under its 50-day moving average as it forms a flat base. It is shooting for a potential entry of 349.77.

But it was Salesforce.com that took top honors on the index after it rose about 1.3%. The stock remains mired below its 200-day line for now.

The clear loser of the day was banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS). It ended the session down 3.2% but is still forming a cup with handle.

Tesla Stock Charges Higher, Rivian Jumps

EV leader Tesla closed up 3.9%. This was enough to make it one of the top performers on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

The stock is now trying to reach a new handle entry of 1,208.10. The new handle is deeper than usual due to recent volatile market conditions.

It comes after a breakout past a double-bottom base buy point of 1,202.05 failed.

Tesla stock gave up all its gains and more after clearing a trendline entry last week. But if the positive market action continues, it could soon retake this level.

Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4. The stock now sits almost 15% below this level. It remains up more than 30% over the past 12 months, however. Tesla is a member of the IBD Leaderboard list of top growth stocks.

Other EV stocks were having mixed luck. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) closed up 3.5%. However Lucid Motors (LCID) paused a rebound as it fell 0.1%.

Covid Testing Stock Plunges On This

Quest Diagnostics had a torrid session, closing down almost 7%.

The clinical lab stock has been plunging since it reported Covid testing volumes in Q4 declined compared with the prior year. The firm said Wednesday Q4 revenue would fall 9%.

This was enough to put a dampener on the fact it reported preliminary Q4 EPS of $3.33. This was higher than analyst views for $3.07 per share.

The stock flashed multiple sell signals, including a break below its 10-week moving average.

Quest also triggered the 7%-8% sell rule. Those who bought the stock following its breakout above a cup base entry of 160.66 should have already sold their shares.

These Stocks Test Buy Points

A trio of stocks managed to move above entries despite the mixed action.

Shopping center REIT Phillips Edison closed in its buy zone after moving past a consolidation pattern entry of 35.07.

The IPO stock saw its relative strength line hit a new high, a bullish sign. Analyst see earnings soaring by 208% in 2022.

Investment banking play Houlihan Lokey closed just below its buy zone after earlier moving above a cup-without-handle entry of 119.99.

Volume was solid here, a good sign. In addition, its RS line almost reached new heights. Big money has been snapping up the stock.

Fabless semiconductor company Cirrus Logic's stock climbed past a cup-with-handle buy point of 95.10.

With the market uptrend still currently under pressure, investors should be extra careful when it come to buying stocks.

It is worth keeping a close tab on stocks performing well under these conditions and add them to one's watchlist.

53,2022-01-12,"Cramer's Mad Money Recap 1/12: Tesla, Ford, GM","Comparisons can sometimes be odious, especially when they keep you from buying great stocks, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Wednesday. There are plenty of pundits that will tell you stock picking is a fools game, but nothing could be further from the truth.

When the market cap of Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report surpassed that of Ford Motor (F) - Get Ford Motor Company Report, the pundits were out in force telling investors that, obviously, Tesla was overvalued. But had you followed that advice, you would have missed out as Tesla shares surpassed that of General Motors (GM) - Get General Motors Company Report, and Toyota (TM) - Get Toyota Motor Corp. Report and then all three combined.

Then there's the pundits' obsession with the Federal Reserve, where they insist that rising interest rates will destroy our economy. But Tuesday, we heard from Fed chair Jay Powell that he's not out to wreck the economy, he's taking a common sense approach to monetary tightening.

The pundits will always tell you that buying the dips is stupid and that index funds are far better than individual stock picking. But in reality, isn't buying at lower prices what you're supposed to do? And if individual stocks are bad for you, how is a basket of them suddenly good for you?

When you're a pundit, it pays to be bearish. If you're a bull, and you get it wrong, you'll be chastised forever. But if you're bearish, well, you're just being cautious.

Cramer told viewers they should have a list of stocks they want to buy, and the prices they want to pay, at the ready. When their stocks reach those prices, ""buy them,"" he said. You'll never make money in the stock market if you're too scared to buy.

Am I Diversified?

In the ""Am I Diversified"" segment, Cramer spoke with callers and responded to tweets sent via Twitter to @JimCramer to see if investors' portfolios have what it takes for today's markets.

The first portfolio included Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report, Coinbase (COIN) , Ford Motor (F) - Get Ford Motor Company Report, Invitae (NVTA) - Get Invitae Corp. Report and PayPal (PYPL) - Get PayPal Holdings, Inc. Report. Cramer suggested selling both Coinbase and Invitae and adding UnitedHealth Group (UNH) - Get UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Report and Honeywell (HON) - Get Honeywell International Inc. Report to be a stronger portfolio that's better diversified.

The second portfolio's top holdings included Southern Company (SO) - Get Southern Company Report, Verizon (VZ) - Get Verizon Communications Inc. Report, ConocoPhillips (COP) - Get ConocoPhillips Report, Philip Morris (PM) - Get Philip Morris International Inc. Report, and Union Pacific (UNP) - Get Union Pacific Corporation Report. Cramer blessed this portfolio as properly diversified.

The third portfolio had Apple, ThermoFisher Scientific (TMO) - Get Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Report, Ford Motor, McDonald's (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation Report and Rocket Lab (RKLB) - Get Rocket Lab USA, Inc. Report as its top five stocks. Cramer said this portfolio was ""perfect.""

The fourth portfolio's top stocks were Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Microsoft Corporation Report, Ford Motor, Apple, Boeing (BA) - Get Boeing Company Report and BP BP. Cramer said he'd allow both Apple and Microsoft to coexist, so this portfolio is properly diversified.

ViacomCBS too Cheap to Ignore?

We're starting to see signs that ViacomCBS (VIAB) - Get Viacom Inc. Class B Report has gotten its act together and the stock might finally be a buy, Cramer told viewers. In fact, trading at just nine times earnings with a 2.7% yield, Viacom has become too cheap to ignore.

For much of last year, the stock of Viacom was untouchable, as the company suffered from a price manipulation scandal. But now that we've rung in the new year and the company has gotten its act together, Cramer said there's a lot to like about this media powerhouse.

When ViacomCBS reports in a few weeks, it will be the first full quarter with an NFL football tailwind. The company's Paramount+ streaming service is also gaining steam, and Viacom's existing library of movies and series is also in high demand.

ViacomCBS is only now starting to receive some attention from the analysts, but Cramer expects to see a lot more as their scandals fall further into the past. With a 2.7% dividend, the stock pays you to wait to hear what the company has to say when it next reports earnings.

Executive Decision: Devon Energy

In his ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Rick Muncrief, CEO of Devon Energy (DVN) - Get Devon Energy Corporation Report, the best performing stock in the S&P 500 last year that still trades for just 10 times earnings.

Muncrief said that Devon's merger with WPX has been going very well and given the combined company terrific assets and terrific people that continue to impress. Their new business model, which includes a variable dividend and a share buyback program, has also been very well received.

Muncrief noted that in years past, oil drillers were compensated for growth, which is why you saw so much volatility. But even before the pandemic, oil producers were becoming more disciplined, offering stability and far less volatility. Those trends only accelerated after COVID.

Devon is currently only 25% hedged in 2022, leaving the majority of their oil free to take advantage of continued price increases. Devon is also continuing to realize synergies from their merger.

Devon also has a focus on sustainability. Muncrief said they've deployed a lot of new technologies to cut their emissions and reduce flaring, and they will continue to do more every year.

Lightning Round

In the Lightning Round, Cramer was bullish on Prothena (PRTA) - Get Prothena Corp. Plc Report and Rio Tinto (RIO) - Get Rio Tinto Plc Report.

Cramer was bearish on Chargepoint (CHPT) - Get ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. Class A Report, Squarespace (SQSP) - Get Squarespace, Inc. Class A Report, Vale (VALE) - Get Vale SA Report, Alibaba (BABA) - Get Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Report and QuantumScape (QS) - Get QuantumScape Corporation Class A Report.

Why Techs May Be the First to Rally

In his ""No Huddle Offense"" segment, Cramer pondered why the tech sector is always the first to rally off the lows. Tech companies have a lot going for them, but to truly understand them, it's easier to look at what they don't have.

Tech companies don't have exposure to commodity inflation or supply-chain woes. They don't have factories or warehouses or unions. They have no exposure to semiconductor shortages, and most importantly, they're nearly standing still.

Everyone needs technology to become more efficient, that's why they're always in high demand.

But not all tech companies are created equal. Those trading on promises, without real earnings, must be sold in a rising interest rate environment. Use any strength to sell this type of tech, Cramer urged. The ones with real earnings however, will remain market darlings for a long time to come.

56,2022-01-12,Cathie Wood Sees Ark Fund Bounce but Don’t Forget It’s a Bear Market,"The ARKK ETF has had a stellar three-day run, but don't be blind to the fact that it's in a bear market. Here are the levels to know now.

Shares of the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK) - Get ARK Innovation ETF Report have had a pretty solid couple of days.

From Monday’s low to Wednesday’s high, the ETF has rallied 11.5%.

However, as good as the rally felt, let’s not lose sight of reality, which is that ARKK remains trapped in a brutal bear market. So do most growth stocks.

If it weren’t for Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report holding up relatively well — ARKK’s top holding — then the ETF would likely be down much more than it is now.

Cathie Wood has blamed some of the losses on the market being irrational.

However, one could argue that the ARKK ETF is still up more than 162% from the 2020 low, which outperforms other major indices by a fair amount.

However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain near the highs, down just a few percent from the all-time high.

Even though buyers of ARKK are still up from the lows, it certainly doesn’t feel that way.

Trading the ARKK ETF

Daily chart of ARKK. Chart courtesy of TrendSpider.com

Earlier this week, we were lucky enough to call out the bullish reversal in ARKK as it reclaimed last week’s low at $82.65.

At the time, it was scary to step into the market as stocks had been in free-fall. But this offered bulls a very clear-cut risk/reward proposal.

By getting long at $82.65, they could use the recent low near $80 as their stop-loss and look to ride the ETF higher. It helped that there was bullish divergence on the RSI reading.

How high it would go was, and to some extent still is, the question.

For now though, I would simply remind traders that the ARKK ETF remains in a bear market. It’s down more than 40% from its all-time high and remains in a painful downtrend.

Looking at today’s action specifically, I was cautious on the ETF after two robust upside rally days and a gap-up on the third day.

Typically, the third day of a big move is not the time to finally get long, but rather, get cautious. In this case specifically, it was actually time to book some profits and/or get short based on the levels.

Because ARKK was running into its declining 10-day moving average, it could run into some resistance. However, the $89 presented just as much of a hurdle. That’s the low from the prior bullish reversal and the December low.

With ARKK peeking above that level and reversing lower, bulls needed to be aware of the significance of this area.

On the downside, last week’s low is on watch. A break of $82.65 puts this month’s low in play near $80. Below that and it’s possible we see the $75 area, where ARKK has its 161.8% downside extension and the rising 200-week moving average.","The ARKK ETF has had a stellar three-day run, but don't be blind to the fact that it's in a bear market.

Summary NEV sales a bright spot as China pushes to curb air pollution

Industry body expects chip shortage to ease this year

CAAM expects NEV sales to surge 47% in 2022

BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China's auto sales last year grew for the first time since 2017, industry data showed on Wednesday, boosted partly by a jump of 1.5 times in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs).

Overall sales in the world's biggest car market rose 3.8% year-on-year, after monthly sales of 2.79 million vehicles in December brought total sales for 2021 to 26.28 million，data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.

Production and sales are expected to be better in 2022 than last year on the prospect that issues such as chip shortage and high prices of raw materials ease, CAAM said in a statement.

After decades of upbeat growth, China's car market started contracting in 2018 under pressure from the phasing out of some tax cuts, a trade war between Washington and Beijing and amid the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The market had started to bounce back by mid-2020, but was pulled down by a global shortage of semiconductors, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, which led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production.

China's auto sales in December fell 1.6% from a year-ago period, the eight consecutive monthly drop, CAAM data showed.

But the sales of NEVs were a bright spot, including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, showing strong momentum with a growth of 157.5% to 3.52 million units in 2021.

In December alone, 531,000 NEVs were sold, representing a surge of 114% year-on-year. China has in recent years heavily promoted NEVs as part of its efforts to curb air pollution.

Last month, CAAM said it expects automobile sales to rise 5.4% to 27.5 million this year, and for NEV sales to grow 47% to five million. read more

China will cut subsidies on NEVs, such as electric cars, by 30% in 2022 and withdraw them altogether at the end of the year, deeming that the market has matured enough in terms of demand to grow without the aid of government help.

But while China's EV market is seeing a very strong growth, most foreign automakers have lagged their Chinese counterparts in designing smart cars that appeal. Tesla (TSLA.O) is the only foreign brand among the top ten.

On Tuesday, data from another Chinese auto association showed that U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) sold a record 70,847 China-made vehicles in December. read more

Volkswagen said it missed its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 units from its ID battery electric series last year, having sold 70,625 vehicles, but that it would likely double sales this year.

59,2022-01-13,2 Reasons Why Tesla Stock Is Toast Today,"What happened

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took another tumble on Thursday, falling 3.6% through 11:10 a.m. ET in response to a couple of negative news items.

So what

Biggest news first: Tesla's electric Cybertruck, which was first unveiled in 2019 with a promise of production by 2021, obviously missed that deadline. Tesla subsequently suggested Cybertrucks might be available for purchase by 2022, but now, even that's in doubt.

As automotive industry website Edmunds.com pointed out last week, and TheVerge.com re-reported today, ""reference to a 2022 production schedule [for Cybertruck] was scrubbed"" from Tesla's website last week. Instead of the promise that ""you will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022,"" the site now says simply that ""you will be able to complete your configuration as production nears"" -- with no indication of how near to production Cybertruck actually is.

Separately and unrelated to the first story, The New York Post reported yesterday afternoon that a 19-year-old German ""IT specialist"" is claiming he has successfully hacked into ""25 Tesla vehicles across 13 countries"" and been able to ""turn on their radios, flash their headlights and even start their engines and begin keyless driving"" remotely.

Now what

Now, the second story sounds more alarming -- but according to the hacker in question, his hacking success was not tied to any ""vulnerability in Tesla's infrastructure."" Rather, it was due to some basic precaution that the car owners apparently failed to follow -- akin to a computer user failing to turn on their antivirus software.

The continued delays in Cybertruck's arrival, on the other hand, seem a greater risk to Tesla stock. On the one hand, as The Verge points out, Cybertruck may simply be ""a relatively low priority"" for Tesla right now. Given that Tesla is already having trouble just keeping up with ""fantastic"" demand for its Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, bringing Cybertruck to market too soon might simply interfere with Tesla's other, more immediate production goals.

That being said, the longer Tesla waits to introduce Cybertruck for sale, the more time General Motors and Ford Motor Company will have to grab market share for their own electric pickups, and the more room to maneuver for Rivian Automotive as well. The longer Tesla waits, the more Cybertruck pre-orders will vanish from its order books.

And if Tesla waits too long, it may find itself shut out of the electric truck market entirely, and confined to building electric cars and SUVs forevermore.","So whatBiggest news first: Tesla's electric Cybertruck, which was first unveiled in 2019 with a promise of production by 2021, obviously missed that deadline.

61,2022-01-13,Tesla Stock Price and Forecast: TSLA bulls back in charge as Powell pushes equities,"TSLA stock surges higher on Wednesday as risk assets rally.

US CPI highest since 1982, but market expecting this.

Tesla shares surge over 4% to close at $1,106.

Tesla (TSLA) and risk assets rallied on Wednesday as the inflation-busting Federal Reserve is on track to raise rates in March. CME fed funds futures expect a 90% chance of a hike now, and this had initially dented investor appetite for risker assets. Tesla fits into this category with its high valuation, but when risk appetites return it tends to outperform. This was the case on Wednesday with a 4% gain for the stock.

Tesla Stock News

The macroeconomic backdrop has once again shifted to favor risk assets, and TSLA shares benefitted. It is not so much the macro environment changing but rather investor perception of it. Investors are growing more comfortable with the thought of higher inflation for longer. The microenvironment also received a boost this week with Tesla hitting a new record for production at its Shanghai plant, according to the latest Chinese data. Volkswagen added to the bullish news for EV makers as it said EV sales were up 97% last year for the German car conglomerate.

Tesla will release its Q4 and full-year earnings on January 26, so we do not have too long to see how these delivery numbers flow through to the bottom line. The last set of earnings showed margins increasing despite rising input costs and supply chain issues. If this trend continues then Tesla should be expected to post another strong set of earnings and beat the street.

Tesla Stock Forecast

The stock is still in a downtrend formation with a series of lower highs, but now it looks like we may have set a higher low. This could indicate a reversal. The low then at $980 from Monday is our key short-term pivot. Above and we stay bullish in the short term with a target of $1,200 and then record highs at $1,243. Break $980, and the next obvious move will be to test $886 and then $843.

62,2022-01-13,Tesla (TSLA) online shop now accepting Dogecoin (DOGE) for some items,"Tesla (TSLA) online shop now accepting Dogecoin (DOGE) for some items Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has promised that the EV company will accept Dogecoin, and the merch shop has followed through with some items being priced in DOGE.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk says a lot of things on Twitter, and some of the promises he makes take a long time to come to fruition, but tonight the world's largest electric vehicle company has taken a massive step forward. Tesla's online merchandise store now accepts Dogecoin. Much Wow!

Some items on Tesla's merch shop are now priced in Dogecoin like this Cyberquad for Kids.

Tesla's CEO has a well-documented history of tweeting a lot, and last May he asked his millions of followers if they wanted the company to accept Dogecoin. With nearly 4 million votes cast, over 78% of participants voted yes. Less than a year later, Musk appears to be making good on this promise to his most rabid crypto bro followers.

Do you want Tesla to accept Doge? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2021

Musk abided by another Twitter poll's results in late 2021 when he asked his followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock holdings, so today's revelation that Tesla is accepting Dogecoin shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. It's important to note that not every product on Tesla's website can be purchased with Dogecoin yet, including their vehicles.

Tesla fanboys can now buy this Giga Texas Belt Buckle for 835 DOGE.

One interesting thing about how Tesla is implementing their acceptance of Dogecoin is that items are priced in DOGE. If Dogecoin's price drops, purchasers of these items will be getting a discount in terms of the US dollar equivalent required to complete the transaction. This likely explains why not everything on the website is priced in DOGE, but tonight is certainly a start.

With Dogecoin down nearly 80% from its all-time highs earlier this week, this news is being received well by holders of the original meme coin. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 10% on this news, which I guess means all of these Tesla products now cost more in terms of dollars.

Elon Musk and Dogecoin truly go together like peanut butter and jelly.

Tonight's news of Tesla accepting Dogecoin will be viewed as a great success for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, but it remains to be seen just how many DOGE holders will jump at the opportunity to use their coins as a medium of exchange. Tesla's foray into Bitcoin payments was largely underwhelming, but perhaps focusing on merch instead of cars that cost up to six figures will lead to better results.

What do you make of this news that Tesla is officially accepting Dogecoin?

64,2022-01-13,Failing Heat Pumps Leave Tesla (TSLA) Owners Freezing,"Recently, several Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) owners have reported that their heat pumps have seemingly stopped working completely in cold weather. Transport Canada, the entity responsible for evaluating vehicle recalls, has received “nine consumer complaints concerning the performance of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) in cold weather conditions on both the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles” so far. The department has opened an investigation “to further evaluate the details of the complaints and to grasp a better understanding of the HVAC operation in cold climates.”

One user, Tyler Selvig, wrote on Twitter, “Our Model Y could have killed my family today when the heat stopped working in -40c Called service and the reset and auto didn’t fix. Hour away from any service. Luckily we had family in an ICE vehicle that I could put my 2 kids under 3yrs old in quickly.”

Another Tesla owner already had his heat pump sensors replaced as a potential solution to the problem. Mark Kroeker tweeted “having some buyers remorse. Last Feb had our Model Y in the SC for a month with no heat. New Super-manifold and thought it was fixed. New set of sensors last week and now this. -30c in #Saskatchewan and a very cold 1 hr drive later we barely made the supercharger.”

Apart from the risk of people freezing while trying to go anywhere, the department raised another massive hazard involving a defective HVAC system: windshield defogging and defrosting.

Transport Canada already warned Tesla about the investigation and said that “communication will be ongoing.” Canada’s Motor Vehicle Safety Act requires companies “to notify Transport Canada and all current owners when they become aware of a defect that could affect the safety of a person.” The EV maker did not alert the Canadian transportation department about the “known firmware concern” it revealed to a customer on December 29.

Late selling saw small caps reverse lower. The Russell 2000 closed down 0.8%.

Bears were also mauling growth stocks. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY), a bellwether for growth stocks, gave up 1.4%.

Dow Jones Reverses As Microsoft Stock Falls

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes. But it ended up surrendering nearly 200 points amid late pressure as it fell 0.5%.

Boeing was the top performer on the Dow Jones today, rising 3%. This allowed the Aerospace giant to retake its 200-day moving average for the first time in months, MarketSmith analysis shows.

Meanwhile, software plays were lagging most on the Dow Jones today. Microsoft stock, a top performer Wednesday, fared worst as it fell 4.2%.

The IBD Leaderboard stock has fallen under its 50-day moving average as it retreats to the bottom of a potential flat base. MSFT is shooting for a potential entry of 349.77.

Salesforce.com was also lagging. It closed near lows for the day as it gave up 3.9%. The stock remains mired below the important 200-day moving average.

Growth Stocks Lead Market Sell-Off; What To Do Now

Ford Stock Passes Milestone, Tesla Stock Plunges

Ford stock was hitting the headlines after the company's market cap passed the $100 billion mark for the first time.

The iconic automaker has seen its share price soar by nearly 160% over the past 12 months.

The stock has been bolstered by its pipeline of electric vehicles. It is not offering a valid buy point at the moment. Buying now would be risky.

In contrast, EV leader Tesla was hammered, dropping 6.8%. The stock lost ground on a new handle entry of 1,208.10. The new handle is deeper than usual due to recent volatile market conditions.

It comes after a breakout past a double-bottom base and a buy point of 1,202.05 failed.

Tesla stock gave up all its gains and more after clearing a trendline entry last week.

Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4. The stock now sits nearly 15% below this level. It remains up more than 30% over the past 12 months, however.

Tesla is a member of the prestigious IBD Leaderboard list of top growth stocks.

Nvidia Stock Slammed As TSM Does This

It was a challenging day for chip leader Nvidia. The Leaderboard stock closed down 5.1%. It fell despite moving higher in premarket action.

The stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average as it digests gains.

It had been given an early boost by Taiwan Semiconductor earnings before reversing lower.

TSM is in a buy zone after shares jumped past a 135.60 buy point of a cup with handle.

It comes after the chip company reported Q4 earnings and sales that bested analyst estimates.

It posted EPS of $1.15, up 19% from the year-earlier period. Analysts expected earnings of $1.12 a share.

For the current quarter, Taiwan Semi expects to generate revenue of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion. The midpoint of $16.9 billion topped analyst estimates for $15.7 billion and would mark a 33% year-over-year increase.

Semiconductor makers rank No. 13 out of IBD's 197 industry groups for six-month price performance.

These Stocks Test Buy Points

Homebuilder PulteGroup came within a penny of passing a cup-with-handle buy point of 58.10 before slipping back. This is a second stage pattern.

Analysts see strong earnings growth for PHM stock in 2022. It moved higher despite the news mortgage rates had risen to their highest levels since March 2020.

Chip equipment stock MKS Instruments fell back after briefly passing a cup-with-handle entry of 180.77. This is a first stage pattern, which means it is more likely to succeed.

Market performance is currently lagging earnings here, and earnings are also imminent. Big money has been buying up the stock of late though.

With the market uptrend still currently under pressure, investors exercise extra caution when it comes to establishing new positions.

It is worth keeping a close tab on stocks performing well under these conditions and add them to one's watchlist.

66,2022-01-13,Top Cryptocurrency Stocks for 2022,"That’s why they’re the best, they’re the positive outliers relative to the rest of the market. These types of stocks have three traits: strong fundamentals, great technicals, and a history of Big Money activity in the shares. Outlier stocks see a lot of Big Money buying.

Oftentimes, that can be institutional activity. We’ll go over what that looks like in a bit. For MAPsignals, we believe that Big Money trading can alert you to the forward fundamental picture of a stock. In other words, Big Money moves markets.

I’ve spent my career in Big Money, primarily focused on stocks. If we can measure where demand is flowing for shares, that’s an edge worth tracking. We want the odds on our side when looking for the highest quality investments.

Well, can we use the same framework with crypto? Our data point to yes. Below are six-month charts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies, with Big Money activity overlayed:

And here are multiyear charts:

Many investors are watching crypto with a close eye. The space has been walloped. And that means stocks whose businesses are exposed to crypto have suffered. But if the crypto pullback is over, those same stocks should bounce. Five stocks we think could benefit are TSLA, COIN, SQ, PYPL, & NVDA.

Tesla

Up first is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), the electric vehicle company. In addition to vehicles, Tesla also owns crypto and accepts it as payment.

The stock has been on a pullback. Great companies on pullbacks are worthy of attention. Check out TSLA:

Year-to-date performance (+0.1%)

Historical Big Money signals

Just to show you what our Big Money signal looks like, have a look at the top buy signals Tesla has made the past few years. Blue bars are showing that TSLA was likely being bought by a Big Money player, according to MAPsignals.

When you see a lot of them, I call it the stairway to heaven:

Source: www.MAPsignals.com

But, what about fundamentals? As you can see, Tesla’s sales and earnings have grown at double-digit rates:

Story continues

3-year sales growth rate (+41.8%)

3-year earnings growth rate (+33.3%)

Next up is Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN), which is a crypto exchange.

Check out these technicals for COIN:

1-month performance (-12.0%)

Historical Big Money signals

Coinbase

There’s been a price dip, but let’s look long-term. This is the Big Money action in COIN. Clearly the Big Money likes it:

Source: www.MAPsignals.com

Let’s look at fundamentals. As you can see, Coinbase has had huge revenue growth. I see that continuing in the years ahead:

1-year sales growth rate = (+649.5%)

3-year sales growth rate = (+139.3%)

Another crypto stock name for 2022 is Block Inc. (SQ), formerly Square, which is a payment processing company. It owns crypto, allows users to trade it, and changed its name to reflect its crypto-focused future.

Strong candidates for growth usually have Big Money buying the shares. Block has that. Also, the stock has been sold heavily of late:

1-month performance (-20.3%)

Historical Big Money signals

Block

Below are the Big Money signals Block has made since 2015. That’s JUICE!

Source: www.MAPsignals.com

Now let’s look a bit closer. The growth is impressive, and I expect more of the same in the future:

1-year sales growth rate = (+118.8%)

1-year earnings growth rate = (+5.3%)

Number four on the list is payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL). It too allows users to trade crypto and is developing its own stablecoin. PYPL has been on a sell streak lately.

Here are the technicals important to me:

1-month performance (-2.9%)

Historical Big Money signals

Paypal

Below are the Big Money signals for PYPL since 2015 – JUICE:

Source: www.MAPsignals.com

Let’s look under the hood. Despite recent price volatility, the fundamentals indicate PayPal has been growing nicely:

3-year sales growth rate = (+18.0%)

3-year earnings growth rate = (+36.1%)

Our last 2022 crypto stock candidate is computer hardware maker NVDIA (NVDA). The company’s graphics cards are popular gamers. They’re also popular with crypto miners, who use computers to solve complex problems to “mine” new crypto coins, since high-end graphics cards are part of the backbone of crypto mining operations.

NVDA has been on a sell streak lately. Check out these technicals:

1-month performance (-9.3%)

Historical Big Money signals

Nvidia

NVDIA is a high-quality stock and has several Big Money buys (blue bars) since 2016:

Source: www.MAPsignals.com

Now look at the fundamentals. Sales and earnings have been rock-solid, with both growing at double-digit rates:

3-year sales growth rate = (+22.2%)

3-year earnings growth rate = (+18.0%)

The Bottom Line

TSLA, COIN, SQ, PYPL, & NVDA represent top crypto stocks for 2022. Strong fundamentals, future prospects, ample crypto exposure, and Big Money buy signals make these stocks worthy of extra attention, especially if crypto prices stage a turnaround.

68,2022-01-13,"Better Buy: Tesla or Equal Parts of Lucid, Rivian, Nio, and Ford?","After making waves in 2021, the electric vehicle (EV) industry has wasted no time making a name for itself so far in 2022. Despite the Nasdaq Composite being negative for the year, share prices of Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) have already gained over 17% each as investors cheer EV investments and accelerated production goals.

Investors looking to take a slice out of the EV pie may consider going with an industry leader like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), or taking more of a basket approach with several EV stocks such as Lucid, Ford, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Nio (NYSE:NIO). Here's the case for each.

The obvious choice is often the best choice

Daniel Foelber (Tesla): The good thing about industry-leading companies is that their strengths and weaknesses are right in the open. Due to its routine media coverage, Tesla's pros and cons are even more broadly discussed than most companies'.

Tesla's long list of strengths starts with its extremely high production and delivery growth rate. 2021 deliveries of 936,172 vehicles were nearly four times higher than its full-year 2018 delivery numbers. High sales and a global footprint have helped Tesla improve its profitability. The full-year results aren't out yet, but Tesla's trailing-12-month figures for the last three years illustrate just how fast its top line and profitability are growing. For example, consider that Tesla's trailing-12-month revenue is up 80% from three years ago, its net income is up to $3.5 billion, and its operating margin is 9.5%.

We'll likely see Tesla's profitability continue to improve as it ramps up production and grows its manufacturing capacity thanks to the launch of Gigafactories in Texas and Germany this year.

Tesla's strengths are its industry-leading position in the global EV market, advanced battery and self-driving technology, first-mover advantage, expansive DC fast-charging network, strong brand equity, a diverse business that includes other energy solutions, and industry-leading operating margin. Its main weakness has nothing to do with Tesla the company, but rather, it has to do with Tesla the stock and its expensive valuation.

If recent history tells us anything, it's that the market will give fundamentally strong businesses premium valuations because it's better to buy a fantastic company for an expensive price than a decent company for a cheap price. Tesla is a fantastic company. And while its stock price could very easily go down over the short term, its long-term strengths show no signs of fading anytime soon. Buying Tesla seems like an easy choice. But so was simply buying large tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet over the last few years -- all three of which crushed the market. Tesla may underperform a basket of EV stocks. But it also could be a simple yet effective solution that's good enough for investors looking for a small position in the EV industry.

Taking emotion out

Howard Smith (Lucid/Rivian/Nio/Ford): Comparing the recent share prices of the undisputed EV king and its up-and-coming competitors is an interesting exercise. Going on three weeks into the new year, the stock movements in 2022 still tell the story for those debating spreading bets or buying into the leader:

Of course, looking at results over a short period is meaningless when judging total returns. But the above chart still shows what investors should think about when deciding how to approach investing in EV manufacturers. Buying shares in the group of Lucid, Rivian, Ford, and Nio will likely result in a mix of results. In just the first month of 2022, that has ranged from a drop of almost 20% to a gain of more than 19%.

That's partly because when it comes to these companies -- and the transition to electrification that Ford has in the works -- there remain many uncertainties and risks. Tesla's path has been well documented, and though there are likely surprises still to come from CEO Elon Musk and company, its EV business is established.

Ford is just beginning to sell its Mach-E, and interest in the F-150 Lightning appears to be off the charts, so investors are betting it will be successful in the EV space. Lucid just began delivering its luxury Air sedans and has plans to grow overseas and with future new vehicle offerings, including its Gravity SUV. It expects to be selling in Europe this year and plans to begin production on the luxury electric SUV late in 2023.

Rivian just recently began trading publicly, and news that early investor and customer Amazon will be spreading its purchases of electric delivery vans among other producers spooked investors.

Nio is the most established EV manufacturer among this group besides Tesla. It has expansion and growth planned for 2022, but investors have already given it a relatively high valuation.

If you believe in Tesla even considering its $1 trillion valuation, that might be the EV stock for you. But if a 40% or 50% drop in shares would cause panic, investing in a group that will likely have some winners and some losers might be a better approach. Lucid, Rivian, Ford, and Nio could all be winners in the EV market. But if not, at least a mix might help take emotion out of the investments. And emotion is rarely beneficial when it comes to investing decisions.

Investing in EV stocks in a way that fits your personal preference

Given the pros and cons of the points discussed, the best option for most investors could be selecting EV stocks that suit your risk tolerance and weighting them accordingly in a basket of EV stocks. For many, that basket could include Tesla. For others, it may carry higher weights of riskier but potentially more rewarding companies like Lucid and Rivian. And for risk-averse investors, it could entail sticking to legacy automakers like Ford that have shown a commitment to investing in the electric car industry.","Its main weakness has nothing to do with Tesla the company, but rather, it has to do with Tesla the stock and its expensive valuation.

69,2022-01-13,5 S&P 500 Stocks Set to Report Triple-Digits Earnings Growth,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is heating up, with total S&P 500 earnings expected to be up 19.9% from the same period last year on 11.9% higher revenues. This would follow a 41.4% rise in earnings on 17.3% higher revenues in the third quarter. Earnings were up 94.8% in the second quarter and 50.3% in the first quarter of 2021.



Given the robust projections, most S&P 500 stocks are likely to post triple-digit earnings growth. Some of these are CF Industries CF, Exxon Mobil XOM, Tesla TSLA, Centene Corporation CNC and Southwest Airlines LUV. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.



According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank increases the chance of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.



You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.



Then we looked for stocks having a triple-digit estimated earnings growth rate for the to-be-reported quarter.

Solid Earnings Trend

Of the 16 Zacks sectors, 11 are expected to earn more relative to the year-ago quarter. Energy, transportation & aerospace will likely see huge earnings growth from the year-ago-quarter as aerospace incurred loss while energy and transportation barely reported positive earnings.

The other eight sectors are expected to witness positive year-over-year earnings growth. Basic materials is expected to be the biggest contributor to S&P 500 earnings with 80.3% growth. This is likely to be followed by consumer discretionary (46.5%), construction (22.2%) and medical (16.7%).



Earnings strength is broad-based, with small caps projected to report solid growth. For the small-cap S&P 600 Index, Q4 total earnings are expected to be up 31.5% from the same period last year on 15% higher revenues. This would follow 352.2% earnings growth on 21.1% revenue growth in Q3.



The earnings growth projection reflects significant deceleration from the last two quarters due to rising cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.

RETAIL INVESTORS PILE INTO STOCKS AT RECORD LEVELS (1155 EST/1655 GMT)

When Wall Street rebounded this week after last week's weakness, strategists and money managers pointed to a boost from retail investors who decided to buy the dip.

Peng Cheng, who works on global quantative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, put out some numbers behind the story in a research note released.

""This past week saw the strongest retail order imbalance in cash equities on record, totaling $5.9 billion,"" Cheng wrote late Wednesday. ""The $1.7 billion inflow on Tuesday was the highest single-day observation in history.""

With 65% of the buying focused on exchange traded funds (ETFs), interest in S&P 500 ETFs was particularly noticable, he added. And while growth sectors have had a comeback this week, Cheng said a number of value ETFs were in the top 10 names bought by retail investors. These included the Energy Select Sector SPDR fund , the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund and the Vanguard Value Index fun .

Besides long-time retail favorites such as Tesla (TSLA.O), which saw $193 million in in-flows, financials had a strong run with Bank of America (BAC.N) bringing in $131 million and Citi (C.N)taking $74 million. In energy, Chevron (CVX.N) saw a strong $92 million inflow.

Still, it's worth noting that retail volume is a relatively small part of the market overall, according to Cheng. Retail market orders for large cap stocks was 8.3% of the market last week compared with 11.6% for small cap stocks.

""While large-cap volumes are roughly in line with activity at the same time last year, small-cap volumes are ~2% lower,"" he said.

PPI, JOBLESS CLAIMS TELL A TALE OF TWO WAVES: OMICRON AND INFLATION (1030 EST/1530 GMT)

A data duet released on Thursday provided another glimmer of hope that the inflation wave has crested and supply chains are right-sizing, even if swelling Omicron infections are leading to longer unemployment lines.

The prices U.S. companies get for their goods at the factory door (USPPFD=ECI) grew at a decelerated pace in December, with the headline 'final demand' print showing a monthly gain of 0.2%, comfortably lower than the 0.4% consensus. read more

On an annual basis, PPI shed 0.1 percentage point to a still-white-hot 9.7%.

The slowdown adds to slowly gathering evidence (notably PMI data) that the hobbled global supply chain is gradually finding its legs.

So-called 'core' PPI, which strips out volatile food, energy and trade services, cooled down as well, rising 0.4% compared with November's 0.8% gain.

Year-on-year, while core PPI growth didn't budge from 6.9%, it remains hotter than consumer gauges (CPI, PCE), which suggests companies aren't quite done passing price increases along to the consumer.

""Persistent supply disruptions will pin producer prices near record levels in the near term, especially given a rapidly spreading Omicron variant that will fan inflation pressures,"" writes Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""The PPI data adds to growing evidence that the Fed will commence rate lift off in March and undergo balance sheet reduction mid-year.""

Indeed, as evidenced by last week's FOMC policy meeting minutes and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's words before Congress this week, the central bank has removed its gloves and called out inflation, with at least three interest rate hikes now in the cards this year. read more

The graphic below shows core PPI and other indicators, all of which continue to sail well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.

Inflation

The number of U.S. workers filling out first-time applications for unemployment benefits (USJOB=ECI) unexpectedly rose last week to 230,000, defying the slight decline to an even 200,000 economists predicted. read more

It was the highest reading in two months, and sits comfortably within the range associated with healthy labor market churn.

But healthy churn unfortunately is not the likely culprit, as rise probably reflects surging infections of the Omicron COVID variant rather than increased willingness on the part of employers to hand out pink slips amid the ongoing worker drought.

""We expect some noise in the data owing to a surge in virus cases which may push up claims temporarily,"" says Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""Beyond weekly moves, filings will likely remain low given businesses will be reluctant to reduce their workforce amid a labor shortage.""

Continuing claims (USJOBN=ECI), reported on a one-week lag, provided the bigger surprise, dropping to 1.559 million and dipping below the 1.7 million level for the first time since mid-March 2020, when mandated lockdowns to contain the pandemic sent the economy into a tailspin.

The jobless claims data jibes well with the Labor Departments December employment report, which showed the newly unemployed's slice of the total jobless pie increasing, while the share of long-term unemployed is shrinking.

Jobless claims

Wall Street initially greeted the data warmly, opening solidly in green territory but slipping into reverse as the session got under way.

At last glance the Dow was the sole gainer among the major U.S. stock indexes, while cyclicals and economically sensitive chips (.SOX), transports (.DJT) and small caps (.SPCY) were having a good day.

WILL FED BLUNDER AS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLIDES? (1000 EST/1500 GMT)

A major policy error may be in the works as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates with consumer confidence in sharp decline, observes Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis in New York.

Consumer confidence in the past 40 years has never been as depressed as it is now before a looming rate hike, LaVorgna says. A sharp slowdown is in the offing because last year's econmic boom was largely due to fiscal stimulus, he says.

Unlike the time prior to past rate hikes, consumer confidence is on the wane instead of rising.

""In fact, the Fed has never increased rates with confidence so low,"" LaVorngna said in a note.

In March 1983 when the Fed nudged the federal funds rate higher, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was at 80.8 had risen 15 points from seven months earlier, he said.

In January 1987, a rate liftoff began with the sentiment index at 90.4. After cutting rates following the stock market crash in October 1987, the Fed raised rates in March 1988 with confidence at 94.6 and it was about the same in 1994, when rates were hiked and confidence was 93.2, LaVorgna said.

Confidence was 107.3 when a hiking cycle began in June 1999, and at the beginning of the last two hiking cycles in June 2004 and December 2015, the index was at 95.6 and 92.6, respectfully.

The average starting value for consumer confidence over the past eight cycles was 94.3, with the trend moving higher. The final December reading was 70.6.

""Today's low and falling level of confidence hints of a policy error if the Fed acts so soon,"" LaVorgna warned.

STOCK INDEX FUTURES ADVANCE AFTER PPI (0910 EST/1410 GMT)

U.S. stock index futures are higher early on Thursday, with the S&P 500 e-minis up about 0.3%, after the latest batch of economic data, including a report showing U.S. producer price inflation slowed in December.

It showed other hopeful signs that inflation has probably peaked. read more Equity investors have been concerned about inflation, with minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting released last week signaling the central bank may have to raise rates sooner than some had expected to curb inflation.

The morning data also included a Labor Department report showing that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose in the first week of January amid raging COVID-19 infections.

The number remained at a level consistent with rapidly tightening labor market conditions, however.

Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday as U.S. consumer prices data roughly met economists' expectations, easing some investor anxiety about inflation.

Friday brings earnings reports from some of Wall Street's biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), to kick off the quarterly reporting period for U.S. companies.

Here is the U.S. premarket snapshot:

71,2022-01-13,RIVN Stock News: Rivian extends rebound as EV sector rises with Tesla,"NASDAQ:RIVN gained 3.51% during Wednesday’s trading session.

The electric truck industry is getting crowded as legacy automakers move in.

General Motors is looking to put a new electric truck on the moon.

NASDAQ:RIVN managed to climb higher for a second straight day on Wednesday as the EV sector continued to fight back from its recent beat down. Shares of Rivian gained 3.51% and closed the trading session at $86.48. The markets managed to close higher for the second straight day as all three major indices finished in the green at the closing bell. The S&P 500 led the way gaining 0.28%, while the NASDAQ rose for the third consecutive day to start the week. Investors shrugged off the rising inflation report that showed historic levels of gains although those mostly fell within the range of analyst expectations.

Stay up to speed with hot stocks' news!

Rivian is fresh off its 2021 vehicle deliveries report which does it officially make it the first mover in the electric truck industry. Unfortunately for Rivian, this sector is about to get really crowded, really fast. Aside from Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) long-awaited Cyber Truck, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), and Dodge are all ready to unleash their popular truck models to the consumer market. Dodge and Stellantis famously just partnered with Rivian’s largest investor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), to create a new electric delivery truck that will serve as direct competition to Rivian.

RIVIAN stock forecast

Speaking of General Motors, the legacy automaker has new plans for its line of electric vehicles. But this isn’t the unveiling of the new Silverado EV. The company is planning an LTV or Lunar Terrain Vehicle, which is a new name for the next generation of moon rovers. As of now this is just a prototype, so nothing is set in stone yet but it is interesting to see the different segments of the automotive industry that are turning to electrification technology.","The electric truck industry is getting crowded as legacy automakers move in.

72,2022-01-13,Dow Jones Futures Rise After Market Rally Pause; Tech Bellwether Signals Earnings Breakout,"Dow Jones futures rose slightly early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally advanced Wednesday, extending a rebound but with the major indexes closing well off session highs.

X

Apple chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is signaling a breakout on strong earnings before Thursday's open, also giving Applied Materials stock a boost. KB Home (KBH) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) also climbed on quarterly results.

Consumer inflation came in slightly hotter than expected on Wednesday, hitting a fresh 39-year high of 7%. But investors appeared relieved that the December inflation report wasn't even worse. Meanwhile, crude oil and copper prices continued to rally, with energy, mining and other commodity-related stocks rallying.

Still, the major indexes backed off morning highs, with the Nasdaq hitting resistance after rebounding since Monday afternoon. Applied Materials (AMAT) rebounded bullishly from its 50-day line while Mosaic (MOS) broke out past a buy point. Tesla (TSLA) was among Wednesday's big movers, reclaiming key support, but is not yet actionable.

Key Earnings

KB Home reported earnings after the close while Taiwan Semiconductor and Delta Air Lines reported early Thursday, kicking off quarterly results for their respective sectors.

KB Home earnings beat views. Sales came in a little light, but the homebuilder gave bullish guidance on revenue, selling prices and profit margins. KBH stock, which was a laggard when rivals were breaking out, rose solidly overnight, signaling moves above the 50-day and 200-day lines.

Taiwan Semiconductor earnings topped estimates, with the chip foundry also guiding up for Q1 revenue. TSM stock rose 4.4% to 138.01, signaling a breakout from an 11-month cup-with-handle base with a 135.60 buy point. As a chip contractor, Taiwan Semi makes chips for Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and many other fabless chipmakers. Meanwhile, TSM also gave a bullish 2022 capital spending forecast. That's good news for chip-equipment makers such as Applied Materials

Apple stock edged lower in premarket trade, still actionable from its 10-week line. Nvidia stock rose a fraction, still below its 50-day line after last week's sell-off.

Delta earnings and revenue slightly topped views. The carrier expects a Q1 loss as the omicron variant spurs major flight cancellations, but it stuck to forecasts for a 2022 profit. DAL stock rose modestly before the open. Shares have been rallying for the past several weeks but are well off 2021 highs, along with other airline stocks. But Delta earnings are important not only for other airlines, but for hotels and online travel sites that are performing better.

Tesla stock and Nvidia are on IBD Leaderboard. Applied Materials and MOS stock are on SwingTrader. AMAT stock is on the IBD 50 list. Mosaic was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.

Stock Market Rally

The stock market rally closed well off morning highs, but the major indexes closed positive.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% in Wednesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 sank 0.7%.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell about 2 basis points to 1.725%, continuing to retreat from Monday's 23-month intraday peak of 1.81%. Crude oil prices climbed 1.8% to $82.64 per barrel, while natural gas shot up more than 10%. Copper prices climbed about 3%.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) advanced 0.8%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dipped 0.3%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) climbed 0.85%. TSM stock, Nvidia and AMAT are major SMH components.

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) rallied 2.3% and Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) edged up 0.5%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) retreated 0.9%, with DAL stock a notable JETS holding. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) closed just below break-even. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) edged up 0.2% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) nudged 0.1% higher. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) dipped 0.3%.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 2.8% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 4.1%. Tesla stock remains the No. 1 holding across ARK Invest's ETFs.

Five Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now

Mosaic Stock

Mosaic stock rose 3.8% to 41.91 on Wednesday, clearing a 41.25 cup-with-handle buy point in above-average volume, according to MarketSmith analysis. MOS stock did back off intraday highs of 42.61.

AMAT Stock

AMAT stock popped 4.7% to 159.55, rebounding bullishly from its 50-day line and breaking a very short trend line entry. It's actionable now. Applied Materials stock also is back above a prior buy point of 159.10, though it's technically no longer valid.

AMAT stock rose nearly 3% before Thursday's open, buoyed by a strong TSM capital spending report. Several other chip-equipment makers rallied.

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock climbed 3.9% to 1,106.22, convincingly reclaiming its 50-day line. From Monday's lows, TSLA stock has rebounded more than 125 points. The 50-day line often offers an early entry, but the EV giant is trying to go straight up after plunging from its Jan. 4 intraday high. For now, Tesla stock remains actionable just above the 1,200 level. Ideally, shares would pause just below or around 1,200 before breaking out.

Market Rally Analysis

The stock market rally continued to rebound Wednesday but definitely backed off early highs.

The Nasdaq composite, up more than 1% intraday, pulled back after hitting its 10-day line and nearly reaching its 21-day moving average. It's still below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones and S&P 500, above their 21-day and 50-day lines, also ran into resistance at their 10-day lines.

The Russell 2000 also reversed from short-term moving averages. But the small-cap index also closed lower.

The market rally was due for a bounce at Monday's lows. Well, we got it. But it's still unclear if that bounce has real legs. Can the Nasdaq reclaim its 50-day line and its year-end levels? Can the S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit new highs? Or will the market rally falter yet again?

We don't have to have an answer right away. A short pause in the major indexes could be constructive. It would be unusual for stocks to race straight up. A little sideways action would let stocks repair themselves, while leaders could stand out.

Energy stocks remain strong, though Wednesday's gains were tame given the big moves in crude oil and natural gas. Financials are looking good. Investors may want to wait for Friday's earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) before making substantial new bets on bank stocks.

Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy

What To Do Now

The market direction may be the most important part of CAN SLIM. You can find top stocks with great fundamentals, but if the market goes south, those leaders will likely falter too. If the market is generally trending higher, most stocks will rise.

If you buy Nvidia stock, Tesla stock or Microsoft (MSFT) right now, you're not only betting on those stocks too early, you're betting the market will show strength. But instead of trying to predict where the market will go, pay attention to what the market is doing now. While it's still a stock market rally, it's under pressure with the market direction in flux.

Complicating matters is that while most growth stocks are struggling, commodity-related stocks and financials are not.

73,2022-01-13,These Automakers Are Tesla's Biggest Threats,"In this segment of ""3 Minute Stocks Updates"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on Jan. 5, Fool contributors Brian Feroldi and Toby Bordelon discuss some of the competition facing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in 2022.

Brian Feroldi: In 2021, Tesla saw two of its direct competitors, upstarts, come public, and they are now well-capitalized. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), which by the way, have market caps of, let's see, Rivian, [laughs] I know its stock is down but its market cap is still $80 billion, and Lucid, $60 billion.

Say what you will about those valuations, that gives them plenty of room to dilute shareholders and raise tons of capital. Should that be something that concerns Tesla shareholders?

Toby Bordelon: Yeah. I have concerns about Tesla's market cap myself, but Rivian and Lucid make Tesla look like a value play by comparison when you really think about it.

But to your question, I think Tesla should be concerned but I think the bigger threat is honestly for GM (NYSE:GM), Volvo (OTC:VLVO.F), all the legacy carmakers now bringing all their resources to bear on electric vehicles. I think the big issue for Tesla is there is now more competition in general.

The start-ups need to be worried about, sure, but I think that's less of an issue for them. When you are the only game in town, that's fantastic, but that's not the case anymore when it comes to electric vehicles. Ford (NYSE:F) F-150 Lightning coming out soon, GM's already got the Hummer out. Rivian is delivering vehicles to customers, although slowly right now.

With Ford, demand was so high for that truck that they doubled production again we found this week. These legacy automakers, Ford, GM, Volvo, they got so many more resources than Rivian and Lucid, I think, at their disposal.

You want to write those two off, but I think that would be my concern, the legacy automakers who have finally woken up as it were and are making a big push in this area. Now, on one level, this is the realization of Elon Musk's dream. He had said in the past that if Tesla goes out of business but that electric cars become a big thing, that's awesome. That's what he was trying to do.

You look at that and you say, great, let's not lose sight of this amazing transition that Elon Musk and Tesla have sparked the auto industry, fantastic. On another level though, from the business of Tesla, if you're a shareholder, I think competing is going to get more difficult. It's not the only option, and in some cases, we talk about trucks right now today, not necessarily the default option for people who want an electric vehicle.

They're going to have to up their game a little bit, but it's good to see the industry revolutionizing and transforming.","Say what you will about those valuations, that gives them plenty of room to dilute shareholders and raise tons of capital.

74,2022-01-13,Electric Vehicle Checkpoint: Tesla Will Raise Price of Self-Driving Feature,"See the latest news for the top stocks in the electric vehicle space including Ford, Rivian, Lucid, Nio, and more.

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report and General Motors (GM) - Get General Motors Company Report recently grabbed the headlines for their self-driving options, but both manufacturers still insist that a human driver must remain alert and supervise the system in case they need to take back control suddenly.

GM describes its Ultra Cruise feature as a ""door-to-door"" hands-free driving system that will allow users to keep their hands off the wheel in 95% of all traffic situations. It will function on most roads, including city streets, subdivision streets, and paved rural roads in addition to highways, without the need for pre-mapping.

Tesla's FSD beta is a system of driving assistance features, like automatically changing lanes and making turns. The software does not make Tesla vehicles fully autonomous. Elon Musk himself said during a 2019 earnings call that Teslas with FSD are ""able to drive from one’s house to work, most likely without interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive.""

Over on Real Money, contributor Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle calls Ford's moves to have the capacity to produce 600,000 battery EVs a year ""electrifying."" Read more of his investing ideas and his EV trading strategies.

It has sophisticated features like “smart summon” which lets drivers call their car from a parking spot to come pick them up, using their smartphone and the Tesla app like a remote control.

The FSD software has drawn a fair amount of scrutiny and criticism. The California Department of Motor Vehicles and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are investigating different aspects of Tesla’s FSD development and technology.

FSD also has a Beta tier, which includes even more advanced features.

Telsa's CEO Elon Musk this past week tweeted that the electric vehicle maker plans to raise the price of its Full Self-Driving autopilot option to $12,000 on Jan. 17.

In a series of tweets, Musk wrote: ""FSD price will rise as we get closer to FSD production code release. Just in the US. Tesla FSD price rising to $12K on Jan 17.""

The Full Self-Driving option for Tesla EVs is currently priced at $10,000. The company last raised the price of FSD in November 2020 from $8,000 to $10,000.

The EV company rolled out its most recent 10.8 beta software for the FSD feature on Dec. 23 to certain Tesla owners. Musk tweeted that an updated 10.9 version of the software should be ready in about a week.

Elon Musk Built A Tunnel Under Las Vegas

Musk built a tunnel under Las Vegas with The Boring Co., which might change transportation and end traffic. He envisions taking traffic off the streets of America's crowded cities and moving it underground or in the air, although Boring Co. hasn't shared any flying car solutions yet.

The LVCC Loop system — a three-station transportation system consisting of 1.7 miles of tunnel — was built in approximately one year (using the now-legacy Godot Tunnel Boring Machine). LVCC Loop's cost was approximately $47M (firm-fixed pricing) for the two tunnels and three stations (two surfaces and one subsurface).

Musk might be trolling all of us or maybe he's unable to tell his good ideas from his bad ones. Either way, he's a visionary who's also a bit of a prankster and his Boring Co. seems to straddle that line.

Tesla shares were tabbed as a 'top pick' for 2022 by Goldman analyst Mark Delaney following the clean-energy carmaker's record fourth quarter deliveries earlier this month.

Delaney raised his price target on Tesla to $1,200 per share, from a previous peg of $1,125, citing ""robust Q4 deliveries"" that he sees as a signal for further unit growth this year and next. He also noted the group's vertical integration of hardware and software, alongside its ecosystem of charging stations, as well as its growth potential in solar and storage.

Here are the top electric vehicle stocks to watch this week:

Tesla

The electric vehicle corporate shuffle hit Tesla Tuesday as the company's Valerie Capers Workman, head of human resources and one of its highest-ranking black employees, left the company. The timing of Workman's departure comes at a time when Tesla has faced multiple high-profile lawsuits of its treatment of black employees and subcontracted workers at the company's plant in Fremont, California. “I am proud of all that I was able to accomplish at Tesla with the support of truly excellent colleagues, especially the People and Legal teams,” Workman said in an email cited by Bloomberg. The EV carmaker has been marred by controversy over the treatment of minorities.

Tesla shares moved higher again Tuesday, trading firmly over the $1,000 mark, following data from China showing record December sales in the world's biggest car market. The China Passenger Car Association said Tesla sold 70,847 China-made cars last month, nearly three times that total recorded last year and more than a third ahead of November's pace. Tesla said on January 2 that global deliveries for the three months ending in December rose 70% from last year to 308,600 units, its sixth consecutive quarterly record, taking the 2021 total to 936,172 units

TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Tesla as a Hold with a rating score of C+.

Ford

The stock of Ford Motor Co. (F) - Get Ford Motor Company Report has the potential for more growth even after a stellar run in 2021, argues Real Money's Stephen “Sarge” Guilfoyle, who sees longer-term appreciation in the cards as demand for electric F-150s surges. Part of Ford’s potential lies in its leadership with Jim Farley at the helm serving as CEO. ""He understands the needs of consumers,"" according to Guilfoyle. “Farley is just a car guy,” Guilfoyle wrote recently on Real Money. ""Farley saw the opportunity in a brand that still had a little something, that still meant something to the American consumer, and most of all... because he is a car guy, Farley understood that both legacy and electric automobile manufacturers had forgotten to build cars that regular people like.”

The company recently said it plans to nearly double the production of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup due to heavy demand from drivers. Ford is warning it will literally pull the plug on any dealer that tries to cut a side-deal and take extra cash for the new Lightning F-150 all-electric pickup, according to a note to dealers sent this past week. That means no selling of “early delivery” slots at a premium, and, most importantly, no added dealership markups, or so-called ADMs, that give one customer an F-150 Lightning over another because they’re willing to pay a markup.

TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Ford as a Buy with a rating score of B.

Rivian

Electric vehicle maker Rivian (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive, Inc. Class A Report said Monday its chief operating officer, Rod Copes, has left the company. Separately it reported production figures in line with lowered guidance it offered last month. The Amazon-backed (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report company said in emailed comments that “Rod began a phased retirement from Rivian several months ago, affording the team continuity as we moved toward production ramp.” Copes’ “duties have been absorbed by our leadership team,” the company added.

In a statement Monday, Rivian said it had produced 1,015 vehicles by the end of 2021. It said it had delivered 920. And, the company's shares briefly dipped this past week below their November initial public offering price. That came after Amazon announced that it will buy electric delivery vans from Stellantis (STLA) - Get Stellantis N.V. Report, bypassing Rivian, its original electric-vehicle purchase partner. Amazon has ordered 100,000 Rivian vans to be delivered by 2030, and it owns a 20% stake in the company. The agreement with Stellantis doesn't represent a slight toward Rivian, Amazon said.

TheStreet Quant Ratings does not have a rating for Rivian.

Nio

NIO (NIO) - Get NIO Inc. (China) Report has made some moves recently, including listing a number of jobs that suggest it plans to enter the U.S. market in 2022. The company also said that it will enter Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden in 2022, and reach 25 countries by 2025, at its annual Nio Day event.

Nio delivered 25,034 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 91,429 in 2021, and the electric carmaker expects to begin delivering the ET7, a premium electric sedan, in March. And two weeks ago, Nio unveiled the ET5, a midsize electric sedan, and said it would begin delivering it to customers in September. The company's deliveries rose 50% in December and 44% in the fourth quarter and they doubled for the full year. In December, Nio reported, 10,489 electric vehicles were delivered, up 50% from a year earlier.

TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Nio as a Sell with a rating score of D.

Lucid

Lucid Motors (LCID) - Get Lucid Group, Inc. Report delivered its first vehicles in the third quarter of 2021 and plans to ramp up in 2022, expecting to sell 20,000 vehicles by the end of the year. The company has added 2.85 million square feet to its Arizona manufacturing facility and it plans to have 20 studios and service centers open by the end of 2022. The company has also set a goal of expanding beyond the U.S.

Lucid recently proposed to offer $1.75 billion of convertible senior notes. The notes, due 2026, are to be sold in a private offering to institutional buyers. Lucid also expects to grant the initial purchasers an option on an additional $262.5 million of notes. The company intends to use the proceeds from the offering to ""finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing 'Eligible Green Investments.'""

TheStreet Quant Ratings does not have a rating for Lucid.

Xpeng

XPeng (XPEV) - Get Xpeng Inc Report deliveries doubled in December and tripled in Q4 and full-year 2021. The Guangzhou company delivered 16,000 EVs in December 2021, exceeding its monthly delivery benchmark of 15,000 “despite ongoing global supply chain challenges.” For the month, customers took delivery of 7,459 of the model P7 sports sedan, 5,030 of the P5 family sedan, and 3,511 of the G3 and G3i. In particular, Xpeng said deliveries of the P5 “ramped up steadily” and the order backlog for the model is “solid.” The company delivered 41,751 cars in the quarter, more than half of them (21,342) the P7. And for the year, deliveries reached 98,155.

TheStreet Recommends: What Going Green Means for Companies and Investors

Xpeng's Chinese EV rival Li Auto (LI) - Get Li Auto Report also saw deliveries more than double last month and in the fourth quarter. The company's deliveries nearly tripled for the year. Li delivered 14,087 of the Model One in December; 35,221 in the quarter and 90,491 for the full year.

EARNINGS SEASON TO START FRIDAY AS BANKS GO FIRST (1420 EST/1920 GMT)

With some of the big U.S. banks due to report results on Friday, fourth-quarter earnings season is about to begin.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will be among companies reporting. The news comes on the heels of a rally in bank shares thanks to rising Treasury yields and interest rate hike expectations for the Federal Reserve.

Inflation, supply bottlenecks and the effects of the fast-spreading Omicron variant on businesses and consumers will be among the hot topics during the reporting period. read more

Overall, year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter than it was in first three quarters of 2021 but still strong at 22.4%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

All 11 of the S&P 500 sectors are slated to show profit growth for the fourth quarter, while revenue growth for the period is seen at 12.1%. That growth level would also be lower than in recent quarters, based on Refinitiv data.

MEGACAP GROWTH TUMBLES AS VALUE SHARES ADVANCE (1350 EST/1850 GMT)

U.S. stocks mostly trended lower in afternoon trade on Thursday, with megacap stocks leading the market lower as defensive sectors kept the Dow Industrials above water.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) led the S&P 500 index lower, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms (FB.O).

Information technology (.SPLRCT) led the market lower while the utilities (.SPLRCU) and industrials (.SPLRCI) led sectors trading higher.

Growth stocks (.IGX) fell 1.50%, while value stocks rose 0.30%. A trend of value outpacing growth has been in place since the beginning of December.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.12%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) slid 0.63% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) fell 1.44%.

RETAIL INVESTORS PILE INTO STOCKS AT RECORD LEVELS (1155 EST/1655 GMT)

When Wall Street rebounded this week after last week's weakness, strategists and money managers pointed to a boost from retail investors who decided to buy the dip.

Peng Cheng, who works on global quantative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, put out some numbers behind the story in a research note released.

""This past week saw the strongest retail order imbalance in cash equities on record, totaling $5.9 billion,"" Cheng wrote late Wednesday. ""The $1.7 billion inflow on Tuesday was the highest single-day observation in history.""

With 65% of the buying focused on exchange traded funds (ETFs), interest in S&P 500 ETFs was particularly noticable, he added. And while growth sectors have had a comeback this week, Cheng said a number of value ETFs were in the top 10 names bought by retail investors. These included the Energy Select Sector SPDR fund , the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund and the Vanguard Value Index fun .

Besides long-time retail favorites such as Tesla (TSLA.O), which saw $193 million in in-flows, financials had a strong run with Bank of America (BAC.N) bringing in $131 million and Citi (C.N)taking $74 million. In energy, Chevron (CVX.N) saw a strong $92 million inflow.

Still, it's worth noting that retail volume is a relatively small part of the market overall, according to Cheng. Retail market orders for large cap stocks was 8.3% of the market last week compared with 11.6% for small cap stocks.

""While large-cap volumes are roughly in line with activity at the same time last year, small-cap volumes are ~2% lower,"" he said.

PPI, JOBLESS CLAIMS TELL A TALE OF TWO WAVES: OMICRON AND INFLATION (1030 EST/1530 GMT)

A data duet released on Thursday provided another glimmer of hope that the inflation wave has crested and supply chains are right-sizing, even if swelling Omicron infections are leading to longer unemployment lines.

The prices U.S. companies get for their goods at the factory door (USPPFD=ECI) grew at a decelerated pace in December, with the headline 'final demand' print showing a monthly gain of 0.2%, comfortably lower than the 0.4% consensus. read more

On an annual basis, PPI shed 0.1 percentage point to a still-white-hot 9.7%.

The slowdown adds to slowly gathering evidence (notably PMI data) that the hobbled global supply chain is gradually finding its legs.

So-called 'core' PPI, which strips out volatile food, energy and trade services, cooled down as well, rising 0.4% compared with November's 0.8% gain.

Year-on-year, while core PPI growth didn't budge from 6.9%, it remains hotter than consumer gauges (CPI, PCE), which suggests companies aren't quite done passing price increases along to the consumer.

""Persistent supply disruptions will pin producer prices near record levels in the near term, especially given a rapidly spreading Omicron variant that will fan inflation pressures,"" writes Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""The PPI data adds to growing evidence that the Fed will commence rate lift off in March and undergo balance sheet reduction mid-year.""

Indeed, as evidenced by last week's FOMC policy meeting minutes and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's words before Congress this week, the central bank has removed its gloves and called out inflation, with at least three interest rate hikes now in the cards this year. read more

The graphic below shows core PPI and other indicators, all of which continue to sail well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.

Inflation

The number of U.S. workers filling out first-time applications for unemployment benefits (USJOB=ECI) unexpectedly rose last week to 230,000, defying the slight decline to an even 200,000 economists predicted. read more

It was the highest reading in two months, and sits comfortably within the range associated with healthy labor market churn.

But healthy churn unfortunately is not the likely culprit, as rise probably reflects surging infections of the Omicron COVID variant rather than increased willingness on the part of employers to hand out pink slips amid the ongoing worker drought.

""We expect some noise in the data owing to a surge in virus cases which may push up claims temporarily,"" says Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""Beyond weekly moves, filings will likely remain low given businesses will be reluctant to reduce their workforce amid a labor shortage.""

Continuing claims (USJOBN=ECI), reported on a one-week lag, provided the bigger surprise, dropping to 1.559 million and dipping below the 1.7 million level for the first time since mid-March 2020, when mandated lockdowns to contain the pandemic sent the economy into a tailspin.

The jobless claims data jibes well with the Labor Departments December employment report, which showed the newly unemployed's slice of the total jobless pie increasing, while the share of long-term unemployed is shrinking.

Jobless claims

Wall Street initially greeted the data warmly, opening solidly in green territory but slipping into reverse as the session got under way.

At last glance the Dow was the sole gainer among the major U.S. stock indexes, while cyclicals and economically sensitive chips (.SOX), transports (.DJT) and small caps (.SPCY) were having a good day.

WILL FED BLUNDER AS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLIDES? (1000 EST/1500 GMT)

A major policy error may be in the works as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates with consumer confidence in sharp decline, observes Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis in New York.

Consumer confidence in the past 40 years has never been as depressed as it is now before a looming rate hike, LaVorgna says. A sharp slowdown is in the offing because last year's econmic boom was largely due to fiscal stimulus, he says.

Unlike the time prior to past rate hikes, consumer confidence is on the wane instead of rising.

""In fact, the Fed has never increased rates with confidence so low,"" LaVorngna said in a note.

In March 1983 when the Fed nudged the federal funds rate higher, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was at 80.8 had risen 15 points from seven months earlier, he said.

In January 1987, a rate liftoff began with the sentiment index at 90.4. After cutting rates following the stock market crash in October 1987, the Fed raised rates in March 1988 with confidence at 94.6 and it was about the same in 1994, when rates were hiked and confidence was 93.2, LaVorgna said.

Confidence was 107.3 when a hiking cycle began in June 1999, and at the beginning of the last two hiking cycles in June 2004 and December 2015, the index was at 95.6 and 92.6, respectfully.

The average starting value for consumer confidence over the past eight cycles was 94.3, with the trend moving higher. The final December reading was 70.6.

""Today's low and falling level of confidence hints of a policy error if the Fed acts so soon,"" LaVorgna warned.

STOCK INDEX FUTURES ADVANCE AFTER PPI (0910 EST/1410 GMT)

U.S. stock index futures are higher early on Thursday, with the S&P 500 e-minis up about 0.3%, after the latest batch of economic data, including a report showing U.S. producer price inflation slowed in December.

It showed other hopeful signs that inflation has probably peaked. read more Equity investors have been concerned about inflation, with minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting released last week signaling the central bank may have to raise rates sooner than some had expected to curb inflation.

The morning data also included a Labor Department report showing that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose in the first week of January amid raging COVID-19 infections.

The number remained at a level consistent with rapidly tightening labor market conditions, however.

Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday as U.S. consumer prices data roughly met economists' expectations, easing some investor anxiety about inflation.

Friday brings earnings reports from some of Wall Street's biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), to kick off the quarterly reporting period for U.S. companies.

76,2022-01-13,"Dear NKLA Stock Fans, Here’s the Latest Catalyst You Should Be Watching","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Electric truck maker and frequent headline-catcher Nikola (NASDAQ:TSLA) has even more promising news in an already strong year. This morning, the EV company reported approval for the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP). It seems Nikola’s comeback story is continuing to add chapters in the new year with another encouraging announcement. Is NKLA stock about to see a resurgence?

Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com

The HVIP approval comes by way of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which certified Nikola’s Tre BEV trucks as zero-emission vehicles. The approval allows California purchasers of the Nikola vehicles to qualify for up to $120,000 in incentives per truck. This will likely further encourage larger fleet orders. And Nikola is no stranger to those lately.

Michael Erickson, Nikola’s global head of battery-electric vehicles, commented on the significance of the HVIP approval. “We applaud CARB’s commitment to a greener future through the HVIP program,” he said. “Our HVIP approval is anticipated to help dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lowers the total cost of ownership for Nikola’s California-based customers.”

Nikola’s Tre BEV trucks are predicted to be the longest-range Class 8 truck approved under the incentive program. The trucks have a range of up to 350 miles on a single charge.

Will Today’s News Fuel a Rebound for NKLA Stock?

Today’s announcement is seemingly the cherry on top of a slew of strong headlines from the company. Since making its first delivery in December, Nikola has reported signing several letters of intent (LOIs) for the purchase of possibly hundreds of its trucks.

Just this week, the company announced that Covenant Logistics (NASDAQ:CVLG) signed an LOI to purchase up to 50 Nikola semi-trucks. Like most previous LOIs, the purchase is dependent on a successful demonstration program.

Unfortunately, despite a strong string of news items from Nikola, investors are still hesitant. After trending up almost 4% premarket, NKLA ended the day down 2.3%. This likely reflects uncertainty stemming from last year’s streak of scandals related to Nikola’s founder, Trevor Milton.

The future remains uncertain for the company. However, that certainly hasn’t stopped the EV maker from continuing to make headline-grabbing deals.

Jan 13 (Reuters) - Fintech startup Spring Free EV and Cox Automotive have partnered to provide used electric vehicles to smaller businesses through a new subscription program, the two companies said Thursday.

Business owners can more affordably shift their fleets from gas-powered to electric vehicles, paying a per-mile usage fee and a modest monthly fee, according to Sunil Paul, chief executive and co-founder of San Francisco-based Spring Free EV.

""The biggest problem with EVs is that they cost too much, especially up front, compared with gas-powered cars, even though the operating cost of EVs is much lower,"" said Paul, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded ride services company Sidecar.

Spring Free EV has vehicle supply agreements with Tesla (TSLA.O), Nissan and others, Paul said.

Atlanta-based Cox, a unit of Cox Enterprises (COXET.UL), will handle vehicle acquisition, refurbishment and delivery, while Spring Free EV will handle the financial transactions with small and medium businesses.

With Spring Free EV's ""mileage purchase agreement,"" there is no up-front cost, Paul said. The agreement works like a subscription, with users required to keep the vehicle for at least a year and a minimum number of miles. A third party owns the vehicles, and users have an option to purchase.

The initial target audience is owners of businesses from ride sharing to delivery with high-mileage vehicle fleets.

Spring Free EV is backed by a number of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus, both of whom also have invested in Joby Aviation (JOBY.N), the electric aerial vehicle startup.

79,2022-01-14,Tesla (TSLA) Falls on Cybertruck Production Delays,"Electric carmaker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) may have indefinitely postponed production of its Cybertruck. The vehicle, whose prototype was unveiled in November 2019, was due for customer delivery in 2021. Last year, the company announced a delay in its production schedule to August 2022 due to the pandemic shutdown.



But the Cybertruck's landing page on the Tesla website now no longer mentions the new date for start of production. The latest change in the vehicle's delivery status was first reported by auto website Edmunds. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had previously tweeted, in November, that he would provide an updated product roadmap in the company's next earnings call on Jan. 26.

Key Takeaways Tesla stock fell by nearly 5% after news that its Cybertruck production date will be delayed yet again.

The electric carmaker previously delayed production of the vehicle to 2022.

Tesla competitors are racing ahead with their plans to release their versions of all-electric pickup trucks.

The company's shares fell by nearly 5% to $1,054.48 after news of the delay came out as investors fretted about its impact on the company's top line. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that the decline was a ""knee jerk reaction"" reaction by investors. According to him, Tesla is likely to have a 2023 production start date for the truck at its facility in Austin, which is slated to begin operations next week.



Design Issues

Tesla was also plagued with supply chain and chip shortage issues that affected other carmakers during the pandemic. However, the company devised workarounds, set new records for deliveries, and even opened two new manufacturing facilities in that period.

The Cybertruck presents its own set of unique design challenges. For example, it will need a massive windshield wiper. Musk has previously tweeted that he was considering deploying a wiper that stows in the front trunk but that it was a ""complex affair.""



When it was launched, the Cybertruck drew sharp reactions from critics and enthusiasts. Its angular and sleek design more resembled a futuristic vehicle than an ordinary pickup truck. CEO Musk's faux pas—an empty boast about the truck's unbreakable ""armor glass""—also generated headlines and viral videos. Less than a year later, he claimed that the company had received more than half-million reservations for the vehicle. (With a refundable $100 deposit, it is relatively easy to reserve the truck on Tesla's website.)



Meanwhile, Tesla's competitors have raced ahead with their own versions of all-electric pickups. For example, Ford Motor Company (F) is slated to begin customer deliveries for an all-electric version of its F-150 truck in Spring 2022. General Motors Company (GM) plans to release a budget all-electric version of its Hummer in the first half of 2023. According to research firm Mordor Intelligence, the market for electric trucks is slated to reach $44 billion by 2026.

","Electric carmaker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) may have indefinitely postponed production of its Cybertruck.
Last year, the company announced a delay in its production schedule to August 2022 due to the pandemic shutdown.
But the Cybertruck's landing page on the Tesla website now no longer mentions the new date for start of production.
Key Takeaways Tesla stock fell by nearly 5% after news that its Cybertruck production date will be delayed yet again.

80,2022-01-14,Tesla Stock Price and Forecast: Why did TSLA stock fall 7% on Thursday?,"Tesla stock dumps on Thursday as tech takes a bath.

TSLA shares fell nearly 7% to close at $1,031.56.

Tesla support at the short-term pivot remains at $980.

Update: Tesla just performed a red to green switch in early trading on Friday with the stock opening down 1%. Currently, the stock is trading up 0.6% at $1,037 as investors grapple with the latest hawkishness from Fed officials. The Nasdaq has performed a similiar red to green switch and is currently up 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow remain in negative territory.

Tech stocks suffered some pretty steep falls on Thursday as more hawkish comments from central bankers put investors back into risk aversion mode. This is slightly surprising when the market had already priced in a March rate hike and appeared content with that. Indeed, yields actually fell on Thursday despite the hawkish commentary. This may have been a case of yet again the narrative being set to suit the outcome. The market had witnessed a pretty solid bounce in tech stocks so far this week. The Nasdaq remains just down over 1.5% after yesterday's steep fall and is down 5% for the year so far.

Tesla Stock Forecast

Tesla is nothing if not volatile, and a high beta stock is always going to see outsized returns. Shares of the EV king proved as much on Thursday as it more than doubled the Nasdaq's loss and closed near the low of the day. Retail investors had become nervous in advance with some stock splits in Nasdaq ETFs giving some unusual premarket indications. Both the ProShares UltraPro Short ETF (SQQQ) and the ProShares UltraPro ETF (TQQQ) underwent stock spits, which showed some large and incorrect moves across many of the investment portals yesterday. Markets were nervous to begin with, and the price action then added to this. Central Bankers were merely remaining consistent with recent hawkish commentary.

In other more interesting news, especially to fans of cryptocurrencies, Tesla began taking Dogecoin (DOGE) as a means of payment for several pieces of merchandise in its online store. Dogecoin was up nearly 6% on Thursday and is powering ahead by 14% on Friday. Whether or not this has to do with Tesla is unclear, but it must be a factor.

Tesla Stock Forecast

The chart is choppy and unclear, but we still hold with our $980 short-term pivot. This is the yearly low so far, and the last significant low in the recent downtrend started in late November 2021. Breaking $980 will see a move to $886 in our view, so it is a big level. Hold and the first target is the spike high from January 4 at $1,208 – this year's high so far.

82,2022-01-14,Tesla (TSLA) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why,"Tesla (TSLA) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.

A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Tesla basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.

Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Tesla imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Tesla

This electric car maker is expected to earn $6.29 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2021, which represents a year-over-year change of 180.8%.

Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Tesla. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 22.2%.

Bottom Line

Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Tesla to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

83,2022-01-14,2021 China Auto Market Review & 2022 Preview: 3 Stocks to Buy,"Auto sales in China, the world’s largest car market, snapped a three-year slump in 2021. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), a total of 26.28 million vehicles were sold in the country last year, marking a 3.8% increase from 2020 levels. But there’s a catch. While COVID-19 concerns and chip deficit disrupted production, the overall vehicle sales growth was primarily driven by strong sales of green vehicles.

With the upward trajectory expected to continue, you can ride the robust EV market in China by investing in Tesla TSLA, NIO Inc. NIO and General Motors GM. Before delving into the stocks, here’s a sneak peek at how China’s auto market (particularly EV sales) fared in 2021 and what you can expect down the road.

December Sales Fall for the 8th Straight Month but EV Momentum Sustains

After decades of blistering growth, the wheels came off China’s auto market in 2018 due to tighter emission standards, trade tensions and economic downturn. In the early months of 2020, China’s vehicle demand was severely hit by coronavirus woes. While sales in the country started to bounce back by mid-2020, the recovery couldn’t sustain for long amid the global chip crunch. In a telling sign that chip shortage was wreaking havoc in the industry, vehicle sales in the country in December 2021 declined for the eighth straight month.

The bright spot for China’s auto market last year was the soaring popularity of EVs. According to data compiled by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), full-year deliveries of new energy vehicles (NEVs) skyrocketed 169% to a record 2.99 million units. Sales of NEVs more than doubled both in November and December. Deliveries jumped 122.3% and 138.9% year over year in November and December to total 378,000 and 505,000 units, respectively. Sales for NEVs in China soared for the 18th consecutive month in December 2021. Per CAAM, sales of NEV surged 157.5% to 3.52 million units in 2021.

Story continues

EV Market on Fire, Prospects Bright

Demand for NEVs has been rising amid climate change concerns, advancement in EV charging infrastructure and favorable government policies. In April 2020, the government of China announced plans to extend subsidies and tax breaks for NEVs such as electric or plug-in hybrid cars for another two years to spur sales. Buoyed by favorable government policies, China — the world’s largest EV market — has been on the uptrend since July 2020 and is seeing solid sales of zero-emission vehicles.

However, this year, China will reduce cash subsidies on NEVs by 30% and scrap them altogether by 2022-end. Industry watchers do not expect EV sales in the country to be impacted by the slashing of subsidies, given that the demand for green vehicles is strong enough to grow without government aid. Quoting Jing Yang, research director of Fitch Ratings, “The new-energy vehicle market in China has evolved to be driven by demand from one that was driven by policies and subsidies.”

While some market experts anticipate risks emerging from coronavirus woes, economic slowdown and high commodity costs to loom over China’s auto industry, they are largely upbeat about the EV momentum, with sales of green vehicles doubling this year. The general secretary of the vehicle industry guild, Cui Dongshu, says “Sales growth by NEVs largely outpaced internal combustion engine-driven (ICE) cars, suggesting that NEVs will continue to replace oil-guzzlers at a quick pace.” Dongshu expects NEV sales in the country to top 6 million units this year. Meanwhile, CAAM envisions NEV sales to surge 47% year over year in 2022 to 5 million units.

EVs in China are on track to reach the 20% nationwide penetration goal in 2022 itself, ahead of the government’s 2025 forecast. Per UBS estimates, three out of five new cars in China are likely to be powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels in 2030. Meanwhile, CAAM envisions NEV sales to rise 47% year over year in 2022 to 5 million units.

Given the upbeat scenario, we highlight three stocks that are likely to help you capitalize on the China EV market’s solid prospects.

3 Stocks in Focus

Tesla: Tesla’s ambitious production plans in the country bode well. China is the second biggest market for this EV behemoth, where the company is spending heavily to boost earnings prospects. Tesla’s Shanghai factory is ramping up well and commands a higher market share in the China EV market. Robust production of Model 3 and Y — which are among the top five hot-selling EVs in the country — at the Shanghai Gigafactory bodes well.

Last month, Tesla sold a record 70,847 China-made vehicles, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, per CPCA data. For the full year 2021, Tesla sold more than 470,000 cars made at its Shanghai factory. TSLA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 32.6% and 40.4%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

NIO: NIO seems well-poised to cement its long-term foothold in the EV market of China. The rising demand for its ES6, ES8 and EC6 models is enhancing the firm’s top line. This year, the firm intends to deliver three new products based on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0, including the ET7 model. Deliveries of ET7 are scheduled to commence in first-quarter 2022. NIO’s battery swap technology is a game-changer and lends it an edge over its peers.

NIO delivered a record-breaking 25,034 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021, to boast a new quarterly delivery benchmark that reflected a 44.3% yearly increase. Its yearly deliveries climbed 109.1% to 91,429 vehicles in 2021. NIO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 90% and 83%, respectively.

General Motors: U.S. auto giant General Motors commands a huge presence in China, which is the biggest EV market in the world. In 2021, GM introduced its revolutionary Ultium platform, to expedite its move toward a zero-emissions future. The company’s next-generation EVs (across all brands) in China will be powered by Ultium Drive. Cadillac will lead the launch with its LYRIQ in the Chinese market, followed by Buick and Chevrolet. The first Ultium Center opened in Shanghai in October to assemble battery packs for locally built EVs.

General Motors had strengthened its line-up in China with Hong Guang Mini EV, which was launched in July 2020 under the Wuling brand. The Hong Guang MINI EV cemented its position as the best-selling EV in China, with sales of 400,000 units. GM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings and sales implies a year-over-year growth of 1.1% and 4.6%, respectively.

The move, which sent dogecoin prices 14% higher, comes a month after Musk said Tesla would test out the digital token as a payment option.

Musk, a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, has heavily influenced prices of dogecoin and bitcoin, and at one point had said the company would accept bitcoin for purchasing its cars before axing plans.

Tesla's merchandise, which also include the recently launched ""Cyberwhistle"" and ""Cyberquad for Kids"", are a hit with its fans, and usually sell out within a few hours of listing.

""Some have noted that goods for doge are selling out even faster than for dollars. This news is a good illustration of crypto's continued penetration of corporate culture,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro.

Musk's tweets on dogecoin, including the one where he called it the ""people's crypto"", have turned the once-obscure digital currency, which began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream. The token's price surged by about 4,000% in 2021.

Tesla disclosed last year it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, and Musk has also said he owns some bitcoin and dogecoin.

Tesla is facing intense competition as legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co (F.N) as well as startups including Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O) are set to launch their electric cars this year.

Tesla's much-awaited Cybertruck will begin production in the first quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to start production in late 2022, Reuters reported.

89,2022-01-14,Want to Bubble Proof Your Portfolio? Then Become a HOAXter,"As Lloyd Bridges' son's character Izzy Mandelbaum Jr. memorably asked in The English Patient episode of Seinfeld, ""You think you're better than me?""

Here's the thing. I don't.

But we live in this crazy era of self-righteousness and moral superiority. It's like, to quote another Seinfeld episode, the Bizarro world.

The stock market should be a refuge from this craziness, but, thanks to the ESG craze, it's not. But, in my previous life, I worked in some of the world's largest investment banks, following auto companies, which were quite large (not Tesla (TSLA) sized in terms of market cap, of course) themselves. So, big companies do big things.

But do they do good, big things or bad, big things? Man, that's above my pay grade.

But let me just offer some insight having seen both sides of the coin. Working for megabucks and then incubating my own financial start-ups, Portfolio Guru LLC and Excelsior Capital Partners, has taught me a few things.

Most importantly, I have learned that capitalism is capitalism. When you try to spin it otherwise... you are making a BIG mistake. Is Apple (AAPL) better than Exxon Mobil (XOM) ? Again, way above my pay grade. I do think hydrocarbons are essential to human life in 2022, and that they pulled billions of people out of poverty in the two centuries from 1822-2022.

But there are some companies that stick in my craw, and let me reiterate that Twitter (TWTR) is one of them. It is a cesspool. Also, TWTR stock happens to be extraordinarily overvalued. In my last research report for OHM Research in Sao Paulo, headlined ""Twitter is a 21st Century Ponzi scheme"", I applied the same cash flow return on assets analysis to Twitter that I had performed in Tesla in a prior OHM Research report.

To my astonishment, TWTR's CFROA has been negative for the past seven quarters. That's, to quote another Seinfeld episode, bonkos. I am on every move Elon makes - and will remain so as my firm owns TSLA puts - but at least Musk makes moves. From a financial standpoint, it is difficult to see any motion from Twitter whatsoever. This is not the time in history to be raising capital - including another $1.05 billion from the divestiture of MoPub - and investing it in T-Bills. That's value destruction in 140 characters.

That's how I judge a stock. Not by my perception of the coolness of its CEO. Elon and I were born a couple months apart in 1971, albeit on different continents, and given my background as an auto analyst - I actually drove GM's EV1 in 1997 - I am sure he and I would have a lot to talk about if we hung out. On the other hand, if I ever ran into Dorsey or Agarwal from Twitter, I am quite certain that our interaction would end with me receiving a restraining order.

So, that's where my new portfolio HOAX (see here) enters the picture. This is a diverse group of companies with operations around the world that offer a clear picture of the global economy. In a word: inflationary. That's good for commodity producers and carriers, and thus my HOAX portfolio has gone gangbusters.

So, there's the rub. By titling the portfolio HOAX, I might be giving you a hint as to where I stand on the longevity of our 4.543 billion year-old planet. She's fine. In the past six months I have traversed her several times, and I haven't seen anything from the windows of a Delta flight that made me anxious. But, as I am writing this at home in New York City, I can hear my radiators whistling up a storm.

So spare me the lectures about the melting earth. My eyes tell me what is happening. People are hurting right now, not because of the weather, but because of the actions of the world's central bankers, and the generational wave of inflation they have created. I will be damned if I don't say anything about it, and thankfully, RM gives me a great platform from which to do so.

Economic history shows that the only guaranteed solution to runaway inflation is a nasty recession, which nobody wants, or to have interest rates that actually reflect the cost of money. I am hoping for the latter.

Investments with higher duration will get crushed in an environment of rising interest rates. Hence my decision to benchmark HOAX with Cathie Wood's (ARKK) .

When there is herd mentality in any market any time, valuations will become stretched and crashes will follow. Tulips, the South Sea, the Nifty Fifty, dotcoms, mortgages, and the rest.

Bubble-proof your portfolio, and add a little HOAX to your life. Rest assured that being a HOAXter means that no one will ever talk to you at a cocktail party again. That, in and of itself, makes the journey worthwhile.

Bank stocks are on the move Friday as several big names in the space release earnings reports.

Let’s dive into that news below to see what’s happening with bank stocks today!

Banks Stocks On the Move: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock isn’t doing so hot today with shares down 5.9% as of Friday morning. That comes alongside the company’s most recent earnings report. Lowered guidance among warnings of headwinds from inflation is behind the fall.

Unfortunately, not even beating estimates could keep JPM from slipping today. The company’s earnings per share of $3.33 beat out Wall Street’s estimate of $3.03 per share. Revenue of $30.35 billion also comes in above analysts’ estimate of $29.9 billion, reports CNBC.

Banks Stocks On the Move: Wells Fargo (WFC)

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock is jumping 1.5% in early morning trading today. This is the result of the company beating out estimates for its fourth quarter of 2021. That includes EPS of $1.38 on revenue of $20.86 billion. Both of those are better than Wall Street’s estimates of $1.12 per share and $18.78 billion.

Banks Stocks On the Move: BlackRock (BLK)

Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) stock is seeing shares drop 1.9% as of this morning. Just like the others, this comes after reporting earnings this morning. The company reported an adjusted EPS of $10.42 on revenue of $5.11 billion. Those are mixed results next to analysts’ estimates of $10.15 per share and revenue of $5.17 billion.

Banks Stocks On the Move: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock is joining those falling with shares down 2.5% as of this morning. Yet again, this comes after the release of its most recent earnings report. The company beat out Wall Street’s estimates with EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $17 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.37 per share on revenue of $16.77 billion.

Even so, investors took note of the company’s year-over-year performance during the quarter. That includes net income dropping 26% from the same time last year, as well as EPS slipping 24% over the same period.

91,2022-01-14,"After Shattering Expectations, Can Tesla Meet Its Demand?","In this segment of ""3 Minute Stocks Updates"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on Jan. 5, Fool contributor Toby Bordelon takes a look at what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) needs to do to fulfill the growing demand for its cars.

Toby Bordelon: Let's talk about Tesla. This is always a fun one. Earlier this week, Tesla reported delivery numbers for the fourth quarter of last year, and they hit another record. Another record delivery, 308,000 cars delivered in Q4, which was a 71% increase over Q4 2020.

I see Brian dancing for joy there. I'm sure he's overjoyed by this being a shareholder. The total for 2021, 936,000 cars, which was an 87% increase from 2020. This far exceeded analysts' expectations. Analysts were looking for 266,000 cars from Q4 and 855,000 for the year. This was well above that level.

Almost all these models were 3 and Y, so we're talking about the lower-end car, but still good margins there. The stock went up, not surprising. When you exceed expectations by that amount, not surprisingly, your stock goes up.

I was a little bit surprised by these numbers, and the reason is because if you will recall, we looked at the Q3 report on ""Beat and Raise"", I believe, maybe you talked about it on this show, I noted that the annual production capacity was a little over a million cars a year. That's what they were telling us. That's with their numbers, not something we came up with. They said in their report, here's our capacity.

The Q4 number is 308,000 per quarter. If you were to annualize that out, you're over 1.2 million. That's a little bit above where that capacity number was, around a little over a million cars a year. These numbers suggest they're at capacity or they're very close to it. I didn't think we would get there this fast. It's possible they're getting more cars out of Shanghai when they showed us that traffic capacity they said Shanghai was greater than.

As they continue to build up that plan, you can see how they can get more out of there. I'm not sure if that was the case, but looking at what they've told us, I honestly don't think we should expect to see a big quarter-over-quarter jump in Q1 unless we get new capacity soon, unless Texas comes online in a big way probably in the next couple of weeks to start making these cars for Q1.

Tesla's problem right now, guys, is not demand. Despite what some skeptics and conspiracy theorists might have you think, they do not have a demand problem. I think that's pretty clear. Their issue when I look at this business is supply. That's the single biggest issue for them, and I think in 2022, they need to focus on getting the Texas and Berlin factories operational and producing at scale to solve these demand problems.

Also, thinking ahead, figure out where their next factory is going to be because it's pretty clear they're growing very rapidly. Supply problems are a better problem to have the demand problems for sure, but it's still a problem we need to solve.

The only thing to note here, there were some controversies this week. Tesla opened a showroom in the Xinjiang region of China where there are accusations of slavery and genocide. A lot of stuff in the media about that beating them up over that, criticizing them.

Tesla is not unique. We've seen other companies face issues, particularly in China. How you do business globally while navigating the political and controversial issues? How do you bring your products to everyone who wants them while being sensitive to issues that might exist in these countries? Especially countries with governments, let's say less ideal than we might like them to be.

I don't know if there is a perfect solution, but they'll have to figure out a way forward as many companies have. I'll just close by giving a quick update. As great as Tesla has been, fascinatingly, Ford (NYSE:F) stock outperformed Tesla stock in 2021. That's something interesting to note.

The F-150 is going to beat the Cybertruck to market. I think that's a near certainty at this point. They're targeting early spring with their first vehicles and Elon Musk is saying 2023 for the Cybertruck in a big way.

Then we just got news today, GM (NYSE:GM) announced their electric truck is coming to the market, Silverado. I think Tesla needs to get that truck out soon if they want to stay competitive, but again, they need more capacity. They need Texas operational to really make that happen.

Good news from Tesla, but they got work to do on expanding this capacity for building the cars that people want to buy.","Despite what some skeptics and conspiracy theorists might have you think, they do not have a demand problem.

5 S&P 500 Stocks Set to Report Triple-Digit Earnings Growth

The fourth-quarter earnings season is heating up, with total S&P 500 earnings expected to be up 19.9% from the same period last year on 11.9% higher revenues. This would follow a 41.4% rise in earnings on 17.3% higher revenues in the third quarter. Earnings were up 94.8% in the second quarter and 50.3% in the first quarter of 2021.

Given the robust projections, most S&P 500 stocks are likely to post triple-digit earnings growth. Some of these areCF Industries, Exxon Mobil, Tesla, Centene Corp. and Southwest Airlines. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank increases the chance of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Then we looked for stocks having a triple-digit estimated earnings growth rate for the to-be-reported quarter.

Solid Earnings Trend

Of the 16 Zacks sectors, 11 are expected to earn more relative to the year-ago quarter. Energy, transportation & aerospace will likely see huge earnings growth from the year-ago-quarter as aerospace incurred losses while energy and transportation barely reported positive earnings.

The other eight sectors are expected to witness positive year-over-year earnings growth. Basic materials is expected to be the biggest contributor to S&P 500 earnings with 80.3% growth. This is likely to be followed by consumer discretionary (46.5%), construction (22.2%) and medical (16.7%).

Story continues

Earnings strength is broad-based, with small caps projected to report solid growth. For the small-cap S&P 600 Index, Q4 total earnings are expected to be up 31.5% from the same period last year on 15% higher revenues. This would follow 352.2% earnings growth on 21.1% revenue growth in Q3.

The earnings growth projection reflects significant deceleration from the last two quarters due to rising cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.

Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything

Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the “Internet of Money” and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we’re still in the early stages of this technology, and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.

Zacks’ has just revealed 3 companies that can help investors capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.

Zacks Investment Research","Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CF Industries CF, Exxon Mobil XOM, Tesla TSLA, Centene Corp. CNC and Southwest Airlines LUV.
These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.
According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank increases the chance of an earnings beat.
Energy, transportation & aerospace will likely see huge earnings growth from the year-ago-quarter as aerospace incurred losses while energy and transportation barely reported positive earnings.
The earnings growth projection reflects significant deceleration from the last two quarters due to rising cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.","['cf', 'positive', 'earnings', 'tesla', 'quarter', 'industries', 'corp', 'southwest', 'highlights', 'exxon', 'rank', 'stocks', 'mobil', 'expected', 'centene', 'zacks', 'investment', 'growth', 'market']"

97,2022-01-14,"Dow Jones Sells Off; Citigroup, JPMorgan Tumble On Earnings","The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply Friday morning, extending losses from Thursday's stock market sell-off. Earnings season heated up with quarterly results from financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

X

Among the Dow Jones leaders, Apple (AAPL) fell 0.4% Friday, while Microsoft (MSFT) was down 0.1%. Also among the Dow 30, financial leaders Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan are near new buy points in today's stock market.

Electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) traded down 1.5%. EV truck rival Rivian (RIVN) fell almost 1%. Lucid Group (LCID) dropped 1%. And Chinese EV leaders Li Auto (LI) and Xpeng Motors (XPEV) were higher.

Among Friday's top stocks to buy and watch, Applied Materials (AMAT), Mosaic (MOS), SVB Financial (SIVB) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are in or near new buy zones. Keep in mind the current stock market health isn't exactly conducive to new purchases.

Microsoft and Tesla are IBD Leaderboard stocks. Applied Materials is an IBD SwingTrader stock. Commercial Metals and SVB Financial featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.

Dow Jones Today:

After the stock market open Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down 0.95%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6%. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.4%. Among exchange traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) dropped 0.4% in morning trade, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) fell 0.6%.

The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher, near 1.74% Friday morning. On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped for a third straight day, closing at 1.71%.

Stock Market Rally Weakens

The stock market posted a disappointing performance Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off sharply. The Nasdaq more than erased all of the prior two days gains, leaving it back near its 200-day moving average. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gave up its 50-day support level.

Thursday's The Big Picture commented: ""Don't entirely give up on the market rally yet. The Nasdaq found support at its long-term 200-day line earlier this week. That could still provide a launch pad for a new sustained rally, although that's less likely right now. If the Nasdaq further weakens and takes out its 200-day line, then more downside is likely. As usual, don't predict the market's direction; be flexible and let the market decide your best course of action.""

Three Top Growth Stocks To Watch In The Current Stock Market Rally

Li Auto stock rose for a third straight session Thursday, gaining 0.1%. The stock is moving up the right side of a consolidation with a 37.55 entry while an early entry at 33.86 is also in play. Shares were up 0.15% Friday.

Xpeng Motors dropped 1.8% Thursday, but still held above the 50-day line. Shares were fashioning a cup with handle, but that formation is gone now. The stock continues to build a consolidation with a 56.55 entry. Aggressive investors could use 51.60 as an earlier entry. Shares inched higher Friday.

Among U.S.-based EV stocks, Lucid Motors shares dropped around 1% Friday. LCID stock remains extended past a 28.49 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Meanwhile, the stock's basing process ran into some trouble after Thursday's 8.85% plunge.

EV-truck maker and recent initial public offering Rivian moved down about 1% Friday, on pace to add to Thursday's 7.1% tumble. RIVN shares closed Thursday about 55% off their post-IPO highs

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock traded down 1.5% Friday, threatening to add to Thursday's nearly 7% dive. Shares again gave up their 50-day moving average Thursday. Last week, the EV leader gave up its critical 50-day moving average line and triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule from a 1,119.10 trend line buy point before staging a three-day rebound.

Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4, but the stock ended Thursday about 17% off that 52-week high.

Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock declined 1.9% Thursday, snapping a four-day win streak. Shares are about 12% past a 153.27 buy point out of a cup-with-handle base, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. Shares fell 0.4% Friday.

Software leader Microsoft skidded 4.2% Thursday, hitting a new recent low. The top Dow Jones stock continues to etch a flat base with a 349.77 buy point, but the stock clearly has more work to do before a potential breakout. Shares were down 0.1% Friday.
